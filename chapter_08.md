# Chapter 8: The Market of the Mind

The eastern walls burned through the night.

Cassian stood in the palace courtyard as dawn broke gray and sullen over Arvenstead. Smoke still rose from a dozen breaches in the city's defenses. The attack had been fierce but brief—a probing assault, not a true siege. The Hollow's forces had withdrawn before midnight, leaving behind bodies and questions.

The intelligence had been wrong. Not entirely false, but wrong enough. The northern force existed, but it had been smaller than reported. The timing had been off. The eastern assault had come a day early. Corvan's confession had been real, but the details—the crucial tactical details—had been carefully corrupted.

And Cassian had delivered them straight to the King's war council.

He pressed the coin between his palms, feeling its feverish warmth. The stolen memories still whispered at the edges of his thoughts—children's faces he'd never seen, love for people who didn't exist. Or perhaps they did exist, but the memories were hollow copies, echoes planted by Draven years ago.

Footsteps approached across the courtyard.

Cassian turned. Mira stood a few paces away, travel cloak already fastened, pack on her shoulder. Her dark hair was tied back, and there were shadows under her eyes. She'd been awake all night too.

"The city held," Cassian said.

"Barely." She crossed the courtyard to stand beside him. "I heard the King's advisors arguing this morning. Half of them blame you for the false intelligence. The other half think you're the only reason the Hollow didn't press harder."

"They're both right." He pocketed the coin. "Draven played me. Used Corvan to deliver information I'd find credible—most of what he said is true." He looked at her. "I warned the council that parts of it felt wrong. That Draven might have fed false details to Corvan. But I didn't push hard enough. I wanted to prove my value, show them I could be useful." His jaw tightened. "I got people killed."

Mira studied his face for a long moment. "How many?"

"Seventeen confirmed. Probably more when they finish searching the rubble." He could still hear the screams from the eastern quarter. Families who'd lived near the walls. "If I'd questioned Corvan more thoroughly. If I'd trusted my instincts about those corrupted memories—"

"Then maybe Draven would have won anyway through a different deception." She touched his arm briefly. "You're not omniscient, Cassian. You warned them the intelligence might be compromised. They chose to act on it anyway."

"A man who keeps making mistakes that cost lives."

"A man who also saved this city from surrendering entirely." She squeezed his arm once, then let go. "The King wants to see you. But first, I need to ask you something."

He turned to face her fully. In the gray dawn light, she looked tired. Worried. And beneath that, something else he couldn't quite read.

"I've been asking around," Mira said carefully. "Talking to refugees. Soldiers. Anyone who might have information about..." She paused. "About the Hollow who were taken recently."

Torin. Her brother. Cassian had almost forgotten in the chaos of the attack.

"I found something," Mira continued. "A soldier who escaped from one of the Hollow's staging camps. He says they keep the newly converted separate for the first few weeks. Training them. Conditioning them. Before they fully integrate them into the army." Her voice quickened with desperate hope. "Torin was taken three weeks ago. If the soldier is right, if my brother is still in that transitional state—"

"Then he might not be fully lost yet," Cassian finished. He saw where this was going. "You want to find him."

"I want to try to reach him." She pulled a folded map from her pack, spread it on a nearby bench. "The soldier said the camp is here. Old aqueduct ruins, north of the city. Maybe three thousand Hollow, including recent conversions." Her finger traced the location. "It's the same northern position from the intelligence you extracted yesterday. The force exists—it's just not planning the attack we were told to expect."

Cassian studied the map. Three thousand. And if they were training newly converted, that meant they were vulnerable. Still figuring out how to use their hollowed soldiers. It was an opportunity.

But it was also a trap. Cassian was sure of it.

"Draven wanted me to know about that camp," Cassian said slowly. "The intelligence about the northern force—that part was true. He wanted the King to send scouts there. Wanted us focused on it." He looked at Mira. "Which means it's probably bait."

"I know." Her jaw set. "But my brother might be there. And if there's even a chance I can reach him before it's too late..." She met his eyes. "I'm going. With or without you. But I'd rather not go alone."

Cassian should have said no. Should have recognized the obvious trap. Should have prioritized the King's summons and the broader war over one woman's desperate quest.

But he looked at Mira's face—the fear barely held in check, the determination born of love—and thought of his own father. Of promises made too late. Of chances not taken.

"We'll need horses," he said. "And we leave immediately, before the King's advisors decide I'm more useful locked in the palace."

Relief flooded her expression. "Thank you. I know it's dangerous—"

"It's suicidal," Cassian corrected. "But I've done stupider things in the last week alone." He folded the map. "And if your brother is there, if there's a way to understand how the Hollow conversion works..." He thought of the corrupted memories still lodged in his mind. "Maybe I can learn something. Figure out how to reverse it."

"Do you really think it's possible?" The hope in her voice was painful to hear. "To bring them back?"

"I don't know." He wouldn't lie to her. "What I did yesterday—extracting memories, understanding trades—it's... I'm still learning how it works. If being Hollow means something was taken away—something traded or stolen—then theoretically I might be able to reverse it." He trailed off. "But I'd need to understand it better first. Maybe...maybe I need to see a fresh convert up close."

"Then let's go find one." Mira shouldered her pack. "I already arranged for horses. Told the stable master we're on the King's business."

"You were that sure I'd say yes?"

She smiled, but it didn't reach her eyes. "I was that sure you're the kind of person who can't say no when someone needs help. Even when you should."

Was that admiration or criticism? Cassian couldn't tell. He retrieved his own travel pack from the guardhouse and followed her toward the stables.

The city was waking up around them. Merchants opening shops, workers heading to repair the damaged walls, children running through streets still littered with debris from the night's chaos. Life continuing despite the war. Despite the losses. It was resilient in a way Cassian found both hopeful and heartbreaking.

They rode out through the north gate an hour later, just as the sun finally broke through the gray clouds. Two riders on a road that led away from safety and toward everything Cassian knew he should avoid.

Mira rode beside him, her face set toward the horizon. Toward her brother. Toward answers or loss or both.

And Cassian carried the coin in his pocket, its warmth pulsing against his chest like a second heartbeat. The stolen memories whispered. The city's dead called for justice he couldn't provide. And somewhere ahead, Draven Kane was waiting.

But first, they had to find a way to save one hollow-eyed young man from an army of three thousand.

Cassian wondered, not for the first time, if he was actually helping anyone or just making everything worse.

The road stretched north into uncertain morning.

---

They stopped at midday in a village called Thornrest, barely more than a crossroads with an inn and a handful of farms. Mira wanted to ask about refugee movements. Cassian wanted information about Hollow activity in the area.

What they found was fear.

The inn was nearly empty despite the lunch hour. The few patrons present sat in corners, speaking in low voices, glancing at the door as if expecting an attack at any moment. The innkeeper—a tired-looking woman with graying hair—took their coin but didn't make eye contact.

"Refugees?" Mira asked. "Have you seen any passing through recently?"

The innkeeper shook her head quickly. Too quickly. "No refugees. No travelers. Just locals." She set down bowls of thin stew and retreated to the kitchen.

Cassian exchanged a glance with Mira. Something was wrong here.

He focused on the coin's perception, letting his awareness expand through the room. The impressions came in abstract fragments: fear thick as smoke, secrets heavy as stones, a community holding its breath. But underneath—underneath there was something else. An absence. A hollowness that made his skin prickle.

"We should eat and move on," Mira said quietly.

But Cassian was already standing, walking toward a man sitting alone near the back corner. The man was perhaps forty, wearing a farmer's rough clothes, staring at his untouched ale. His posture was wrong. Too still. Too perfect.

"Sir?" Cassian approached carefully. "Are you well?"

The man looked up. His eyes were clear. Alert. But behind them—nothing. An emptiness that made Cassian's stomach clench.

"I'm fine," the man said. His voice was pleasant. Calm. Utterly devoid of inflection. "Why do you ask?"

"You just seem..." Cassian struggled for words. "Distant."

"Ah." The man smiled. It didn't reach his eyes because there was nothing behind them to reach. "You're perceptive. Not many notice." He gestured to the empty chair across from him. "Sit. You're curious. I can answer questions."

Cassian sat slowly, acutely aware of Mira moving to stand behind him. Her hand rested on the knife at her belt.

"You're Hollow," Cassian said. It wasn't a question.

"I am." The man took a sip of his ale with mechanical precision. "I chose it six months ago. A traveling preacher offered me freedom from grief. My wife had died the year before. My children had moved away. I was alone with memories that hurt more than I could bear." He set down the mug. "So I accepted the trade. And now I don't hurt anymore."

"But you don't feel anything at all," Cassian said.

"Correct." The man's smile remained fixed. "No pain. No joy. No fear or hope or longing. Just... calm. It's very peaceful."

"Why are you still here? In this village? Why not join the Hollow's army?"

"They haven't called for me yet. When they do, I'll go. In the meantime, I work my farm. Sleep in my house. Exist." The man tilted his head, studying Cassian with that terrible emptiness. "You're different, though. I can sense it. There's a weight to you. Something more than ordinary." He leaned forward slightly. "Are you one of them? The ones who traded away what he has?"

Cassian's remained silent. In way, he was. Not as a Hollow, but as a bearer of the coin.

"Interesting." The man smiled that empty smile. "Then you understand what I've chosen. Value. Exchange. Sacrifice." He leaned back. "Tell me—what makes your trades different from the one I made? You sacrifice pieces of yourself. I sacrificed myself to escape pain. Aren't we both just making the exchanges we need to survive?"

"I choose what I give up," Cassian said. "You gave up everything."

"Did I? Or did I give up the one thing that was destroying me—the capacity to suffer—and keep everything else?" The man gestured to himself. "I still walk. Talk. Think. Work. I'm alive. Functional. Useful. I'm just not burdened by emotions that served no purpose except to hurt me."

"That burden is what makes you human."

"Perhaps humanity is overrated." The man finished his ale. "You'll see, eventually. When the weight becomes too much. When you've traded away so many pieces of yourself that you can't remember why you started. The Hollow will make you the same offer they made me. And you'll have to decide if peace is worth the price."

He stood, placed a coin on the table, and walked out of the inn with perfect, mechanical calm.

Cassian sat frozen, his mind reeling. The conversation had felt like looking into a mirror that showed his possible future. The man had been right about one thing: Cassian had been sacrificing pieces of himself. Taking on burdens. Making trades that cost more than he'd anticipated.

How long before there was nothing left to give?

"Cassian." Mira's hand on his shoulder pulled him back. "We should go. Now. If there's one Hollow here, there might be more."

She was right. But as they left the inn and retrieved their horses, Cassian couldn't stop thinking about the man's empty eyes. The terrible peace of having nothing left to lose.

Was that what waited for Mira's brother? Was that what she was hoping to save him from?

Or was he already too far gone?

---

They made camp that night in a small clearing off the road, hidden by a dense copse of trees. No fire—too visible. They ate dried meat and hard bread in the gathering darkness, speaking little.

Mira sat with her back against a tree, staring at the locket she wore around her neck. Cassian had seen her touch it countless times over the past days, but tonight she opened it, revealing a small portrait of a young man. Her brother, presumably.

"He looks like you," Cassian said quietly.

"Everyone said that." Mira's thumb brushed the painted face. "Same dark hair. Same stubborn jaw. But he was always the smart one. The idealistic one. He wanted to change the world." Her voice cracked slightly. "Wanted to help people. Create things that would make life better. Heal the sick. Feed the hungry. All those impossible dreams."

"What happened?"

"He failed." She said it simply, but the weight behind the word was crushing. "Over and over. His inventions didn't work. His ideas were dismissed. He watched people he loved suffer while he remained powerless to help them." She closed the locket. "When our mother died two months ago, from a plague he'd been trying to cure... he broke. Completely. He spent weeks just staring at the wall. Crying. Blaming himself."

"And then the Hollow came."

"They came to our city three weeks ago," Mira confirmed. "Not to conquer. To recruit. They set up in the market square, and a preacher stood on a platform and offered trades. 'Give us your grief, and we'll give you peace. Give us your guilt, and we'll give you purpose. Give us your fear, and we'll give you strength.'" She looked at Cassian. "They told anyone who accepted that they would become hollow. Would lose what made them themselves. But for people drowning in suffering, drowning in feelings they couldn't bear..."

"It seemed like mercy," Cassian finished.

"They gave Torin a golden locket. Told him exactly what it would do. 'Open this, and your suffering ends. Trade your pain for peace. You'll be free.' He held it for three days. Turning it over. Staring at it. I begged him not to open it. Told him I'd help him through his grief. That it would get better with time."

"But he didn't believe you."

"He looked at me," Mira whispered, "and said, 'I can't carry this anymore. I'm drowning. At least if I'm hollow, I won't feel this pain.' And he opened the locket." She closed her eyes. "I watched the life drain out of his face. Everything that made him Torin just... gone. Replaced by calm, empty nothing. He hugged me goodbye like I was a stranger he vaguely recognized. Then they took him. They took the locket back—said it would be needed for others."

She looked at Cassian with desperate intensity. "One of the refugees I spoke with said that the newly converted are kept separate for several weeks. Still being... conditioned. Not yet fully integrated. If that's true, if there's still some part of him that remembers..." Her hand gripped his. "We're running out of time."

Cassian felt the weight of her desperation settle on him like a physical force. Another burden. Another promise he wasn't sure he could keep.

"I'll do everything I can," he said. "If there's a way—"

"Why?" The question caught him off guard. Mira was staring at him now with an expression he couldn't quite read. "Why would you help me? You don't know me. Don't know Torin. You have bigger problems—the King, the war, Draven. Why risk your life for a stranger?"

Cassian opened his mouth, then closed it. Why was he doing this?

"Because I understand what it's like to lose someone and not understand why," he said finally. "My father spent years chasing myths and legends. Everyone said he was a mad fool. And when he died, I had so many questions left unanswered. So many chances I didn't take to understand him." He looked down at the coin in his palm. "If I can help you avoid that same regret... maybe it means something. Maybe it helps justify all the other sacrifices."

Or maybe he just couldn't stand to watch another person suffer when he had the power to potentially help.

Either way, he was committed now.

Mira studied him for a long moment, then nodded. "Thank you." She stood, moved to her bedroll. "We should sleep. Tomorrow we reach the aqueduct ruins."

"Mira?" She paused. "What will you do if we reach him and he can't be saved? If he's too far gone?"

She was silent for so long Cassian thought she wouldn't answer. Then, quietly: "I'll say goodbye. One last time. So at least I'll know I tried everything."

She lay down, turning away from him. Conversation over.

Cassian sat alone in the darkness, the coin warm in his hand, and wondered how many more impossible promises he could make before he broke under the weight of them all.

---

The aqueduct ruins appeared at midday, rising from the landscape like the bones of some ancient beast. Massive stone arches stretched across a dried riverbed, crumbling but still imposing. And surrounding them, spread across the valley, was the Hollow's camp.

Mira had been right about the numbers. Three thousand, maybe more. Rows of identical tents, organized with military precision. Cookfires burning at regular intervals. Sentries posted at every approach.

But it was the people that made Cassian's chest tighten.

Even from this distance, watching from a ridge above the valley, he could see them moving through the camp with that same terrible calm he'd seen in the Thornrest farmer. No shouting. No laughter. No chaos of a normal military encampment. Just efficient, mechanical movement. People performing tasks because that's what they were told to do, not because they cared about the outcome.

"Do you see him?" Cassian asked quietly.

Mira had her spyglass pressed to her eye, scanning the camp with desperate focus. "There are too many. And they all look..." She lowered the glass, and Cassian saw tears on her cheeks. "They all look the same."

A column of people was being marched into the center of the camp as they watched. Perhaps fifty individuals, escorted by Hollow guards. New converts, Cassian realized. Being brought in for processing.

"There," Mira breathed. "Third person from the front. Dark hair, slim build. That could be him."

Cassian took the spyglass, focused on the figure she'd indicated. A young man, maybe twenty-five. Dark hair, yes. Moving with the same mechanical precision as the others. His face was turned away, so Cassian couldn't see his features clearly.

"We need to get closer," Cassian said. "Confirm it's him before we do anything."

"How? There are three thousand Hollow down there. We can't just walk in."

"No." Cassian focused his strange perception on the camp below, trying to understand the pattern. The structure. The rules that governed this place. "But we might be able to slip in after dark. If we can find where they're keeping the new converts..."

A voice spoke behind them, cold and flat. "You're making a mistake."

Cassian spun, hand going to his knife.

A cloaked figure stood ten paces away, perfectly still. A man, from the voice and build, but his face was hidden in shadow beneath his hood.

"Coming here," the figure continued, "it was a trap."

"I know it's a trap," Cassian said. "But we have to try anyway."

"Why?" The figure tilted his head, studying them with unnerving intensity. "One life against three thousand. One brother against the entire Hollow force in this region. The mathematics don't favor you."

"Mathematics isn't everything," Mira said coldly. "Who are you? Why have you been following us?"

The figure was silent for a long moment. Then, slowly, he reached up and pulled back his hood.

Cassian's breath caught.

The man's face was young—maybe thirty—but his eyes were ancient. Empty. Hollow. And yet, unlike every other Hollow Cassian had encountered, there was something behind that emptiness. A spark. A struggling consciousness.

"My name is Korrin," the man said. "I serve Draven Kane. Three years ago, he offered me a trade, and I accepted. I've been hollow ever since. But..." He paused, as if the words were difficult. "I'm not like the rest. not exactly. I can still...feel things. Fragments of what I used to be."

"Then why warn us?" Cassian demanded. "Why not just capture us? Bring us to Draven?"

"Because..." Korrin's voice cracked slightly. The first hint of real emotion. "Because that's what I'm supposed to do. Those are my orders. But watching you... trying to help people, making impossible sacrifices..." He looked away. "You remind me of who I used to be. Before I gave it all away."

"Can you feel that?" Mira asked quietly. "If you're truly Hollow—"

"The Hollow don't feel anything," Korrin interrupted. "But I do. Just barely. Like trying to remember a dream. It's not much. But it's enough to make me question my orders." He focused on Cassian. "Enough to make me want to help you, even though it contradicts what I'm told to do."

"Help us then," Cassian said. "Tell us how to get into that camp. Where they keep the new converts. How the process works."

Korrin shook his head. "I can't directly betray my orders. Something prevents it. But I can... fail to stop you. Provide information." He pointed toward the camp. "The new converts are kept in the western section. Those three large tents at the edge. They're separated until the transformation completes—usually four to six weeks."

"Three weeks," Mira whispered. "Torin's been gone three weeks."

"Then he's still in transition," Korrin said. "But you can't just walk in and take him. He's bound by the trade he made. Only Draven can fully release someone from that bond."

"Then we force him to," Cassian said. "We make a trade. Bargain for her brother's freedom."

"Draven makes the terms," Korrin said flatly. "And right now, he's got three thousand pieces of leverage." He looked between them. "But there might be another way. If you could reach your brother directly... speak to him... There are things even Draven doesn't fully control. The newly converted still have fragments of memory. Echoes of who they were. If you could awaken those..."

"Would that work?"

"I don't know." Korrin's voice held a ghost of longing. "But if it did... if you could prove someone could come back from being Hollow..." He didn't finish the sentence.

Cassian understood. Korrin wanted to believe he could be saved too.

"Help us," Cassian said. "Get us into that camp. If we succeed, maybe others can be saved too."

"Don't promise me salvation," Korrin interrupted harshly. "I'm not your responsibility. I'm just someone whose orders happen to conflict with a ghost of conscience." He turned to leave. "Wait until full dark. The sentries rotate at midnight. Enter from the western approach, behind the supply tents. You'll have perhaps twenty minutes before the next patrol."

"Why are you really doing this?" Mira called after him.

Korrin paused at the edge of the ridge. "Because I remember having a sister once. I can't recall her face. Can't remember her name. But I remember begging her not to cry when they took me." His voice dropped to barely a whisper. "I don't want anyone else to feel what she must have felt."

Then he was gone, vanishing into the afternoon shadows.

Cassian and Mira stared at the place he'd been, then at each other.

"We're going to try this," Mira said. Not a question.

"We're going to try this," Cassian confirmed.

They settled in to wait for nightfall, watching the Hollow camp below, preparing for what would likely be the most dangerous negotiation of Cassian's short career as a coin-bearer.

If they succeeded, they'd save one man and possibly learn how to reverse what the Hollow did.

If they failed, they'd join the three thousand empty souls below.

Either way, by morning, something would have changed.

Cassian pulled out the coin, feeling its warmth. He closed his eyes and tried to focus—not on planning or calculating, but on understanding. Reaching deeper into that place of perception the coin granted him. Trying to see beyond the surface of things to the fundamental patterns beneath.

It was a technique he'd been developing since that moment in the council chamber when he'd extracted Corvan's memories. Each time he used his strange ability, he understood it better. Saw the abstract impressions more clearly. The coin didn't give him answers—it showed him patterns, fragments, pieces he had to assemble himself.

Now he let his awareness expand, trying to understand what they would face in that camp below.

---

The world shifted.

Not physically, but in perception. Cassian found himself in a gray space—not seeing it with his eyes, but experiencing it with some other sense entirely. Like standing in fog where abstract impressions of value floated like motes of light.

It felt like standing at the threshold of something vast. A place where the rules of exchange became visible. Where the invisible architecture of trade and value revealed itself.

He focused his will, trying to understand what he needed: How to reach someone who'd traded away their humanity. How to restore what had been taken.

The impressions swirled, coalescing into abstract images. He saw the golden locket. Saw it opening. Saw something being pulled out—not just memories or emotions, but essence. Core identity. The fundamental pattern that made a person themselves.

And he saw where it went. Not just stored in the locket. Transferred. Moved to another place. A vast reservoir of stolen humanity, growing larger with each conversion.

*Every Hollow isn't just empty,* Cassian realized with horror. *They're connected. Part of a network. All their humanity flows somewhere central.*

Which meant freeing one Hollow wouldn't just require restoring what they'd lost. It would require severing that connection. Cutting them off from whatever collected all that stolen essence.

*Can I do that?*

Something in the gray space stirred. A presence. Not the coin itself—or perhaps it was, he couldn't tell. But it felt... aware. Watching.

And it answered—not in words, but in sensation. In understanding that bloomed directly in his mind.

Yes. He could try. But the cost...

The cost would be taking that connection into himself. Temporarily. Just long enough to sever it. Which meant for those few moments, Cassian would be connected to the network. Would feel the weight of all those hollow souls. Would touch whatever vast reservoir Draven had created.

And Draven would know. Would sense him immediately.

*Minutes at most,* Cassian understood. *Maybe seconds before he responds.*

The presence seemed to pulse—affirmation or warning, he couldn't tell. And then it showed him one more thing.

Cassian saw himself after such a trade. Saw the cost etched into his spirit. Every trade left marks. Every burden carried changed him. If he took on that connection, even briefly...

He would be one step closer to becoming what he fought against.

The gray space began to fade.

Cassian opened his eyes, gasping. The sun had set while he'd been... wherever he'd been. Stars were beginning to appear overhead. Mira was shaking his shoulder, concern on her face.

"You were somewhere else," she said. "Just sitting there, eyes closed, barely breathing. I thought—"

"I think I understand how to do it," Cassian interrupted. His voice was hoarse. "How to try to save your brother. But it's dangerous. And we need to move quickly once we start. Draven will sense what I'm doing."

They gathered their gear in silence and began the descent into the valley. Into the camp. Into whatever waited in those western tents.

Cassian carried the coin in one hand, its warmth almost painful now. The presence in the Silent Market still lingered at the edge of his awareness, watching.

Always watching.

And somewhere in that camp below, a hollow-eyed young man named Torin waited, unaware that his sister was coming to either save him or say goodbye.

Midnight approached.

And for the first time since inheriting the coin, Cassian wondered if he would survive the night.
