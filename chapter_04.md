# Chapter 4: Three Days

Day one of three.

Cassian woke to the sound of hammering.

He stumbled to the window of the counting house and looked out onto the market square. A crew was already at work in the pre-dawn grey, erecting a platform in the square's center. Not a stage for announcements—Cassian recognized the design immediately. A trade post. The kind merchants used for official contracts and witnessed exchanges.

The Hollow's trade post.

They'd said three days. Cassian had assumed that meant three days before they returned. But no—they'd begun immediately. Setting up their apparatus, making themselves visible, letting their presence seep into the town's consciousness.

Smart. Terrifying. But smart.

By the time the sun rose fully, the platform was complete. A simple wooden structure with a desk, two chairs, and a contract ledger bound in black leather. No guards stood watch. No emissary sat waiting. Just the structure itself, promising solutions to anyone desperate enough to approach it.

And people were already gathering to stare.

---

The magistrate called an emergency council meeting before noon.

Cassian wasn't technically on the council—he was just the ledger-keeper—but Torven had summoned "anyone with relevant expertise in contracts and trade negotiations." Translation: anyone who might help him figure out how to weasel out of this situation.

The council chamber was packed. Merchants, guild leaders, the town's wealthiest residents. And one empty chair where the King's representative should have sat. The King's messenger hadn't arrived. Millhaven was on its own.

"We need to discuss terms," Torven began without preamble. "The emissary said we could negotiate. That means there's room for—"

"There's no room." Marcus stood near the back wall, still wearing refugee's rags. Several councilors turned to glare at him for interrupting. "I've seen this before. They offer what they offer. You take it or you don't. There's no middle ground."

"You weren't invited to this meeting," a merchant snapped.

"I've lived through what you're about to experience," Marcus said flatly. "That makes me more qualified than anyone in this room."

Torven waved a hand irritably. "Fine. Stay. But if you're going to speak, please stick to the facts. What exactly did they offer your town?"

"Relief from tax debts. Food for the hungry. Protection from bandits." Marcus's voice was hollow. "Everything they offered you. And the price seemed reasonable: just acknowledge their authority. Sign a document stating our town recognized the Hollow's sovereignty over our lands."

"That's it?" A merchant leaned forward. "Just a signature?"

"That's never it," Cassian said quietly.

All eyes turned to him.

"The document you sign," Cassian continued, "what are the exact terms? Does anyone remember what the emissary said?"

Silence.

"He said we'd have to 'acknowledge their authority,'" Torven said slowly. "And 'accept their terms of fair exchange.' Those were his words."

"What terms?" Cassian pressed. "What specific terms?"

More silence.

"That's the problem," Marcus said. "They don't tell you the full terms until you're ready to sign. Until you're desperate enough that you'll sign anything. And by then—"

The door burst open.

A woman stumbled in, wild-eyed, clutching a piece of parchment. Cassian recognized her—Elara, the baker's wife. Her husband had died in the king's war last year, leaving her with three children and a failing shop.

"Please," she gasped, looking around the room desperately. "I need—someone needs to tell me this is wrong. That I'm being foolish." She held up the parchment, her hands shaking. "The emissary gave me this. He said they can erase my debts. All of them. I won't lose the shop. My children will eat. And the price seems... it seems reasonable. But it can't be. Can it? Please tell me it's a trick. Tell me I'm not seeing this clearly."

Her voice cracked. "Because if it's real—if it's truly as fair as it looks—then I'd be a fool not to sign. And I don't want to be a fool. But I don't want to damn myself either."

Torven stood. "Show me that document."

But Cassian was faster. He crossed the room in three strides and took the parchment gently from Elara's trembling hands. She let him take it, too exhausted to resist.

The contract was beautifully written. Elegant script on expensive vellum. The terms were laid out with perfect legal precision:

*Party of the First Part (Elara of Millhaven) agrees to surrender all outstanding debts, financial obligations, and associated burdens to Party of the Second Part (The Hollow, represented by Emissary Valen). In exchange, Party of the First Part receives freedom from said obligations, guaranteed sustenance for dependent children, and security of home and livelihood.*

*Payment shall be rendered in the form of Service, duration and nature to be determined by Party of the Second Part in accordance with traditional principles of fair exchange. Party of the First Part acknowledges that "Service" may encompass any form of compensation deemed equivalent in value to the relief provided.*

Cassian read it twice. The language was maddeningly vague. "Service" could mean anything. "Equivalent in value" was deliberately undefined. And "traditional principles" meant nothing without knowing which traditions they referred to.

"Don't sign this," Cassian said.

Elara's face crumpled. "But it seems fair. They're taking my debts, I give them service. People do that all the time. Bonded labor, apprenticeships—"

"Look at the payment terms." Cassian pointed to the clause. "It says 'any form of compensation.' Do you understand what that means? They're not specifying what they'll take. It could be labor. Or it could be something else entirely."

"But the emissary explained—he said I'd work for them. Help distribute food to the poor. That's all. He was very clear—"

"Then why isn't it written here?" Cassian demanded. "If that's truly all they want, why doesn't the contract say 'five years of labor' or 'ten hours per week of service'? Why is it vague?"

"I—I don't know."

"It won't save them," Marcus interrupted, his voice hard. "It'll turn you into something that looks like their mother but isn't. You'll feed them, house them, keep them alive. But you won't love them anymore. You won't remember why you ever cared."

"You're lying." But Elara's voice wavered.

"I watched my daughter-in-law sign a contract like this," Marcus said quietly. "She came back from their tent expressionless. Calm. Empty. She couldn't remember her son's name. Couldn't remember she'd ever had a reason to grieve."

Elara looked between them, tears streaming down her face. "But what else can I do? I owe Master Torven six months' rent. I owe the grain merchant. I owe the tax collector. If I don't pay by month's end, they'll take everything anyway."

Every eye in the room turned to Torven.

The magistrate's face had gone carefully neutral. "Business is business. The baker knew the terms when she borrowed."

"You're forcing her into their arms," Cassian said, his voice low and dangerous.

"I'm enforcing contracts. Legal obligations." Torven met his gaze coldly. "Something a ledger-keeper should understand."

The tension in the room was suffocating.

"I'll help you," Cassian said to Elara. "There has to be another way. Give me until tomorrow. Don't sign anything yet."

"Tomorrow?" Elara laughed bitterly. "What changes tomorrow?"

"Let me try."

She stared at him for a long moment. Then, slowly, she took the contract back. "One day," she whispered. "But if you can't help... I'm signing. I won't let my children starve."

She left, still clutching the parchment.

The council erupted in argument the moment the door closed.

"We can't help everyone who's in debt—"

"If we accept the Hollow's terms for the whole town, maybe we can protect individuals—"

"Are you mad? You saw what they did to those refugees—"

"Better them than us!"

Cassian didn't wait to hear more. He left the chamber and walked straight to the market square.

The trade post stood like a tombstone in the morning light.

And sitting behind the desk, as if he'd been waiting all along, was Valen.

---

The emissary looked up as Cassian approached, and his smile was pleasant. Warm, even. Like greeting an old friend.

"Master Cassian. The ledger-keeper who values precision." Valen gestured to the empty chair across from him. "Please. Sit. I was hoping we'd have a chance to speak."

Cassian remained standing. "You knew I'd come."

"You have the look of someone who needs answers." Valen leaned back in his chair. "You've seen the refugees, haven't you? The ones who fled their cities rather than accept our help. They tell you stories. Probably very frightening stories."

"They tell me what you do to people."

"What we *offer* people," Valen corrected. "There's a difference. Every person who signs our contracts does so freely. We explain the terms. We answer questions. We hide nothing. And yet they choose us anyway. Do you know why?"

Cassian didn't answer.

"Because we're honest," Valen said simply. "Your magistrate lies. Your king lies. They promise prosperity and deliver poverty. They promise protection and deliver war. They take your taxes and your sons and give you nothing in return but empty words." He tapped the contract ledger. "We give you exactly what we promise. The trade is always fair."

"You take people's souls."

"We take what they agree to give. And in exchange, they receive relief from suffering they couldn't bear." Valen's expression was earnest, almost sympathetic. "You saw Elara today. Desperate. Drowning in debt. Three children depending on her. Tell me, Master Cassian—what would you have her do? Starve with dignity? Watch her children beg in the streets because she's too proud to accept help?"

"There are other ways to help her."

"Are there?" Valen raised an eyebrow. "Then why haven't you? Why hasn't your magistrate forgiven her debts? Why hasn't your wealthy merchant guild offered loans? Why hasn't your King sent relief?" He leaned forward. "You know why. Because helping costs them something. But condemning her costs nothing. So they'll let her suffer and call it 'personal responsibility.' We, at least, offer her a choice."

"A choice to stop being human."

"A choice to stop *suffering*." Valen's voice was patient, as if explaining something simple to a child. "Humanity is suffering, Master Cassian. Love means loss. Hope means disappointment. Desire means frustration. We offer people freedom from that endless cycle. And they choose it. Gratefully."

Cassian's hands clenched into fists. "You're making evil look like mercy."

"I'm offering desperate people relief from impossible situations." Valen's smile never wavered. "Fair exchange. Informed consent. Balanced scales. The only difference between us and your magistrate is that we deliver what we promise."

"And what did you promise the people of Elara's city? Before you hollowed them out?"

"We promised relief. And we delivered it." Valen opened the ledger, flipped through pages of contracts, each signed in different hands. "Every person who signed these documents knew the terms. Read them carefully. Asked questions. And chose freely. Some regretted it later, yes. But that's the nature of choices, isn't it? We all make trades we regret."

He closed the ledger and met Cassian's gaze.

"Your town has two days left to decide. I hope they choose wisely. I hope they choose us. Because the alternative..." He gestured toward the road where refugees still huddled in their makeshift camp. "The alternative is to run. To flee from town to town, watching the Hollow spread while you pretend there's anywhere left to hide. Or you can stay and fight us. And we'll kill you. Not because we want to, but because you force us to defend what we've built."

"What you've stolen."

"What you've *traded* for." Valen stood, and suddenly his pleasant demeanor cracked just slightly. Beneath it, Cassian saw something cold and vast. "You're young. Inexperienced. You think you can save everyone with good intentions and moral outrage. But you're a child playing in an arena you don't comprehend. Our master has been perfecting this art for decades. He knows secrets you couldn't imagine. Techniques that would shatter your mind if you tried to grasp them."

He stepped around the desk, moving closer.

"I'm going to tell you something out of professional courtesy, ledger-keeper to ledger-keeper. When the Hollow comes to your town—and it will, whether you sign or not—you have three options. One: Sign. Become one of us. Stop hurting. Two: Run. Flee to the next town and wait for us to arrive there too. Three: Die fighting for a world that was broken long before we arrived to fix it."

"There's a fourth option," Cassian said quietly.

"Oh?"

"Stop you."

Valen laughed. It was genuine, warm, almost fond. "With what? Your determination? Your moral certainty? Your father tried that, you know. He came to our master twenty years ago, convinced he could end the Hollow's spread. Convinced he had the power to unmake what we'd built." The emissary's smile turned sad. "He left broken. Went home to watch his family fall apart while he chased answers he'd never find. Is that the option you're choosing?"

The words hit like physical blows. His father had confronted them. Had tried to stop them. And failed so completely that it destroyed his life.

"Why are you telling me this?" Cassian managed.

"Because I'm trying to help you." Valen's voice was sincere. Painfully sincere. "You seem like a decent man. You care about people. You want to do the right thing. Those are good qualities. Admirable qualities. But they're going to get you killed or broken or hollowed. So I'm offering you mercy."

He held out a piece of parchment. A contract.

"Sign this. Join us. You'll keep your mind, your memories, your sense of self. You'll just stop feeling the pain of watching everything you love crumble. You'll stop caring that the world is cruel. And in return, you'll help us bring peace to others. Fair exchange."

Cassian looked at the contract. At Valen's earnest expression. At the shimmer around the emissary that showed something fundamentally twisted where a human soul should be.

And he understood.

This was the Hollow's true weapon. Not force. Not fear. But *reasonableness*. They made damnation sound like salvation. Made emptiness look like peace. Made the destruction of everything human seem like the only logical choice.

"No," Cassian said.

Valen sighed. "Then you have two days to change your mind. I'll be here when you do."

He sat back down at his desk, pulled out a fresh contract, and began writing. As if Cassian had already left.

As if the conversation was already over.

Cassian walked away, his heart pounding, his mind racing.

Two days to save Elara.

Two days to save his town.

Two days to figure out how to fight an enemy who made evil look like kindness.

---

Day two of three.

Cassian spent the night searching his father's journals for anything—any scrap of information about how Rowan had tried to fight the Hollow. But the entries were fragmented, increasingly desperate. Pages ripped out. Entire sections burned or blacked out with ink. As if his father had been trying to hide his methods even from himself.

One entry, dated twenty years ago, was barely legible:

*Confronted him today. Thought I understood the power. Thought I could turn it against him. I was wrong. So wrong. He showed me what he's built—a system where evil is the only logical choice. Where suffering is so great that people BEG to be emptied. And the Law allows it. The Law REQUIRES it, because the trades are fair.*

*I can't fight him. Can't stop him. All I can do is hide the fragment and hope someone stronger finds it. Someone who can see what I couldn't. Do what I couldn't.*

*Emma keeps asking why I'm not sleeping. What can I tell her? That I've seen the future? That the world is going to hollow itself out one desperate trade at a time, and there's nothing I can do to stop it?*

The entry ended there.

Cassian sat back, cold spreading through his chest. His father hadn't hidden the coin to protect it. He'd hidden it because he'd given up. Because he'd faced Draven Kane and realized he couldn't win.

A knock at the door startled him from his thoughts.

It was Widow Marta from Southgate district—the woman he'd corrected the tax records for in what felt like a lifetime ago. She was holding a basket of bread, her expression carefully neutral.

"Master Cassian. I heard you were trying to help Elara." She set the basket on his desk. "Thought you might need to eat."

"Thank you." Cassian gestured for her to sit, but she remained standing.

"I also came to tell you to stop." Her voice was quiet but firm. "What you're trying to do—it's kind. But it's going to get you killed. Or worse."

"I can't just let her sign that contract."

"Why not?" Marta's expression was tired. "You think you're saving her by delaying the inevitable? The Hollow is coming whether we want them or not. At least if she signs now, she makes the choice herself. Has some control."

"She'll lose everything that makes her who she is."

"And if she doesn't sign, she'll lose her home and her children starve. Is that better? Is suffering with your soul intact somehow more noble than peace without it?" Marta's hands twisted in her apron. "I've been thinking about it. The emissary's offer. For our district. For all of us in Southgate who can barely afford to eat. He says he can erase our debts. Give us work that pays fairly. All we have to do is acknowledge the Hollow's authority."

Cassian stared at her. "You're considering it."

"I'm a widow with two sons, Master Cassian. One is fourteen—conscription age in two years. The King will take him to fight this war. The war against the Hollow. He'll die in some field far from home, and I'll get a letter thanking me for his sacrifice." Her voice cracked. "Or I could sign a paper. Keep my boys safe. Keep food on the table. Is that so wrong?"

"It's not real safety. It's—"

"It's more than the King's offering me." She met his gaze. "You corrected our tax records. You stood up to the magistrate for us. And I'm grateful. But you can't fix this. Nobody can. So maybe... maybe the Hollow's way isn't perfect, but at least it's honest about what it costs."

She left before Cassian could respond.

He sat alone in the counting house, the smell of fresh bread mocking him, and realized the horrible truth: Marta wasn't wrong. From her perspective, from Elara's perspective, from the perspective of anyone drowning in debt and fear and impossible choices, the Hollow looked like salvation.

That was the genius of it. Draven Kane had built a system that exploited the failures of kingdoms and kings. Every tax that was too high, every debt that crushed, every war that took sons from mothers—all of it fed the Hollow's growth. They didn't have to conquer. They just had to wait for people to become desperate enough to choose oblivion.

Cassian pulled out the coin and stared at it.

The artifact that was supposed to help him understand value. That was supposed to give him power over exchange. But what good was understanding value when people's lives had been systematically devalued until selling their souls looked like a fair trade?

He had to do something. Had to try.

Even if his father had failed. Even if the attempt destroyed him the way it had destroyed Rowan.

Because the alternative was watching everyone he'd tried to help sign contracts that would erase them.

---

He found Marcus in the refugee camp, sitting by a small fire, staring into the flames.

"I need to know how to fight them," Cassian said without preamble.

Marcus didn't look up. "You can't."

"My father tried. Twenty years ago. He failed, but he tried. There must be something—"

"Your father was a fool." Marcus's voice was flat. "I knew him, you know. Before he went to confront the Hollow. He came through my city, asking questions, gathering information. He was convinced he could stop them. Said he'd found something—some kind of leverage. Wouldn't tell me what." Finally, Marcus looked up. "He came back three months later. Broken. Wouldn't speak of what happened. Just kept muttering about 'fairness' and 'balance' over and over, like they'd driven him mad."

"What does that mean?"

"It means the Hollow's system looks legitimate. By every principle of fair exchange they claim to follow, what they do appears lawful. Monstrous, but lawful. You can't fight them. You'll lose."

"Then how—"

"You run." Marcus stood, his expression hard. "You take everyone you care about and you run. That's the only way to survive. The Hollow keeps spreading, but there's still land beyond their reach. For now. Get there. Build something new. Don't waste your life trying to save people who've already given up."

"I can't abandon them."

"Then you'll die with them. Or worse." Marcus turned away, back to his fire. "Your father tried to fight them head-on. Confronted their leader directly. It broke him. Sometimes the only way to survive is to live to fight another day, even if that means abandoning the current battle."

Cassian left the camp feeling more hopeless than before.

He walked through the town, watching people go about their daily business with forced normality. But he could see the fear beneath the surface. Could see the way eyes drifted toward the trade post in the square. The way conversations stopped when he passed. The way desperate people were weighing options in their minds.

How many would sign by tomorrow? How many would choose emptiness over struggle?

How many could he save?

The sun was setting when he saw the child.

A small boy, maybe six years old, playing alone near the trade post. He was building something with sticks and stones, humming tunelessly to himself. Too young to understand what the platform meant. Too young to know his world was ending.

As Cassian watched, the boy's mother emerged from a nearby shop. She saw her son near the post and went rigid. Called his name—sharp, afraid. The boy looked up, confused by her tone, and ran to her. She grabbed him, held him tight, and hurried away.

But not before Cassian saw her glance back at the trade post.

Saw the terrible calculation in her eyes.

Saw a mother weighing her child's life against her soul and wondering which was worth more.

That was when Cassian knew.

He couldn't save everyone. Couldn't prevent every signature. Couldn't stop the Hollow from taking what desperate people offered them.

But maybe he could save one person. One woman drowning in debt with three children depending on her.

Maybe that would be enough.

---

He went to Varon's shop as evening fell.

The old merchant was closing up, pulling shutters over his display windows. He looked up as Cassian approached, and something like resignation crossed his face.

"No," Varon said before Cassian could speak.

"You don't know what I'm going to ask."

"You're going to ask me to forgive Elara's debt. Or loan her money. Or do something charitable that costs me a fortune." Varon continued shuttering windows. "The answer is no. I'm a merchant, not a charity."

"The Hollow is at your door," Cassian said. "If they take this town, what happens to your fortune? Your shop? Everything you've built?"

"They'll honor property rights. The emissary said—"

"The emissary lies." Cassian stepped closer. "Or rather, he tells a truth that hides a larger lie. They'll honor your property. But they'll hollow you out so completely that you won't remember why you wanted property in the first place. You'll own everything and value nothing."

Varon's hands stilled on the shutters.

"Help me save Elara," Cassian said quietly. "Not because it's charity. Because it's survival. Every person who signs with the Hollow makes them stronger. Makes our town weaker. Makes it easier for them to take the next person. And the next. Until they take you."

"And if I help her?" Varon's voice was measured. "If I forgive her debts? What stops the next desperate person from asking? And the next? How many do I save before I've given away everything I have?"

"I don't know." Cassian met his gaze. "But I know what happens if we don't try. I've seen it in the refugees. In the empty guards. In the children who aren't children anymore. If we don't help each other, the Hollow wins by default."

Varon was silent for a long moment.

Then: "What did you give me for the compass?"

Cassian blinked at the non sequitur. "A seed."

"Why did I accept it?"

"Because..." Cassian thought back to that exchange. To the vision he'd had of Varon's lost love. "Because it was worth more to you than money. Because it represented something you'd lost and couldn't buy back."

"Value isn't always measured in coin," Varon said quietly. "You taught me that. Or reminded me, rather." He sighed. "The baker's debt is six months' rent plus interest. Sixty gold crowns. I can forgive the rent. But I can't forgive the coin debt she owes to others. That's beyond my power."

"How much does she owe in total?"

"Perhaps ninety crowns."

Ninety gold crowns. A fortune. More than Cassian could earn in five years.

"I'll find the rest," Cassian said.

Varon's eyebrow rose. "How?"

"I don't know yet. But I'll find it."

The merchant studied him for a long moment. Then, surprisingly, he smiled. It wasn't warm, but it wasn't cruel either. Just tired.

"You're as foolish as your father," Varon said. "Chasing impossible solutions to impossible problems. I suppose that's admirable, in its way." He opened his shop door. "Come in. Let's draft the debt forgiveness before I change my mind."

---

Day three of three.

Cassian woke to screaming.

He threw on his coat and ran into the square. A crowd had gathered near the trade post, and the sound was coming from the center of it—a woman's voice, raw and broken, keening like an animal in pain.

He pushed through the crowd and stopped cold.

Elara knelt on the cobblestones, clutching her eldest daughter. The girl was perhaps eight years old. And she was empty.

The child's eyes were open but unfocused. Her breathing was steady. But when Elara shook her, called her name, pleaded with her to respond—nothing. The girl simply stared at nothing, face slack, presence gone.

"What happened?" Cassian demanded.

A merchant standing nearby answered, voice shaking. "The girl came to the trade post this morning. Early, before dawn. She had a contract—asked the emissary to sign it. She traded herself to clear her mother's debts."

Cassian's blood turned to ice. "She's eight years old."

"Old enough to sign her name," Valen's voice came from behind him. The emissary stood at the edge of the crowd, his expression professionally sympathetic. "Old enough to make a choice."

"She's a child!" Cassian roared. "She doesn't understand what she signed!"

"She understood perfectly." Valen gestured to the girl. "She knew her mother was suffering. Knew the family would lose everything. So she offered what she had: herself. Her essence in exchange for her family's security. We accepted the trade. Age doesn't determine value."

Elara looked up at Valen with such hatred that the crowd stepped back. "You did this. You knew I wouldn't sign. So you took my daughter instead."

"I took nothing." Valen's voice was calm, patient. "She came to me. She chose. And now your debts are cleared. Your family is secure. She gave you what you needed. You should be grateful."

"Grateful?" Elara's voice broke. "You've killed her!"

"I've freed her from a life of poverty and suffering." Valen knelt beside the girl, reached out to touch her shoulder gently. She didn't respond. "She'll never know hunger again. Never know fear or pain or loss. She's perfect now. Pure. Unburdened by the weight of her hard life."

He stood, brushed off his knees.

"Your town has until sundown to give your answer. Accept our terms, or face our armies. Those are your options." He looked directly at Cassian. "I hope you choose wisely. For everyone's sake."

He walked away, leaving Elara sobbing over her daughter's empty shell.

---

The town meeting that afternoon was the ugliest thing Cassian had ever witnessed.

Half the town wanted to fight. The other half wanted to sign. And Elara... Elara stood in the center of the hall, holding her hollow daughter, and said nothing. Just stared at the assembled crowd with dead eyes.

"We can't let this stand!" someone shouted. "That monster stole a child!"

"He didn't steal anything," Magistrate Torven said coldly. "The girl signed a legal contract. Under our laws—"

"Damn the laws!" The blacksmith stood, fists clenched. "Are we really going to hide behind legal technicalities while children are hollowed out in front of us?"

"What would you have us do?" a merchant countered. "Fight? With what army? What weapons? They'll slaughter us!"

"Better dead than hollow!"

"Easy for you to say—you don't have three children depending on you!"

The shouting escalated. People were turning on each other, accusations flying, fear and anger mixing into something combustible.

And through it all, Cassian stood frozen.

He'd tried to save Elara. Had gotten Varon to forgive the debts. Had been so close to finding a solution.

But he'd been too slow. Too ineffective. And now a child had paid the price for his failure.

He looked down at the coin in his palm. The artifact that was supposed to give him power. That was supposed to help him understand value and exchange. But what good was it? What good was any of it?

His father had tried to fight the Hollow and failed. Marcus had tried to resist and watched his city fall. And now Cassian was repeating the same pattern—trying to save people who couldn't be saved, fighting an enemy he didn't know how to defeat.

Maybe Valen was right. Maybe the only logical choice was to accept the inevitable. To sign the contract, stop feeling the pain, and let the world hollow itself out in peace.

The thought was seductive. Terrifying in how seductive it was.

"Cassian."

He looked up. Seris stood at the back of the hall, barely visible in the shadows. She gestured for him to follow, then slipped out the door.

He followed her into the alley behind the town hall. She was waiting, her expression grim.

"You're losing," she said without preamble.

"I know."

"Your town is going to fall. Tonight, tomorrow, a week from now—it doesn't matter. The Hollow has already won. You're just delaying the inevitable."

"Then why are you here?"

"Because you still have a choice to make. And you need information before you make it." Seris glanced back toward the chaos of the town meeting. "Your father tried to fight the Hollow twenty years ago. He failed because he didn't understand what he was facing. Didn't understand the power they wield or how they corrupted it."

"And you do?"

"No. But I can take you to someone who does." She met his gaze. "There's a place beneath this town. Older than Millhaven. Older than the kingdom itself. Your father went there once, seeking answers. He found some, but not enough. Maybe you'll have better luck."

Cassian felt a chill run down his spine. "What kind of place?"

"The kind where secret trades are made. Trades that don't see the light of day." Seris turned away. "Meet me at the old chapel tonight. Midnight. I'll take you there. What you learn might give you a chance—a slim one—of understanding what you're up against." She paused at the mouth of the alley. "Or it might convince you that running is the only sane option. Either way, you'll know the truth."

"Who is this person? How do they know about the Hollow?"

"Questions that will be answered—if you're willing to pay the price." Her expression was grim. 

"What price? What should I bring?"

"Nothing you could carry would be enough." Seris met his gaze steadily. "The trade will not be in coins or goods. It's deeper than that. More permanent. If you want answers, be prepared to give up something you can't get back."

"Then what—"

"Just come. And come willing to trade. That's all I can tell you." Before Cassian could ask more, she disappeared into the night.

---

The rest of the day passed in a blur of dread and indecision.

Cassian tried to work, to focus on ledgers and numbers, but his mind kept returning to Seris's words. A place beneath the town. Trades that went deeper than coin. Something he couldn't get back.

What was she taking him to?

By evening, the town had reached a breaking point. Groups formed in the square, arguing. Some wanted to accept the Hollow's terms. Others wanted to flee. A few—very few—talked about fighting.

Cassian watched from the counting house window as Widow Marta approached the trade post. She stood there for long minutes, staring at it, her hands twisted in her apron. Then, slowly, she turned away and walked back toward Southgate.

Not today. But tomorrow? How many tomorrows did anyone have left?

As night fell, Cassian made his decision.

He would go with Seris. Would see this place beneath the town. Would learn what his father had learned—or failed to learn.

Because the alternative was standing here paralyzed, watching his town die by degrees while he did nothing.

He touched the coin in his pocket, feeling its familiar weight. Whatever price this mysterious person demanded, he'd find a way to pay it.

Though Seris's warning echoed in his mind: *Nothing you could carry would be sufficient.*

What did that mean? What could be taken from him that he couldn't carry?

The question haunted him as he waited for midnight.

Midnight found him at the old chapel.

The building loomed against the starless sky, its broken roof like jagged teeth. Cassian had passed it a thousand times, barely noticing it—just another relic of the town's past, slowly crumbling into forgotten history.

Now it looked ominous. Expectant.

Seris emerged from the shadows by the entrance. "You came."

"Did you think I wouldn't?"

"I thought you might choose ignorance. It's often easier." She gestured toward the chapel. "Last chance to turn back. Once we go down, there's no leaving without paying the price. The old powers don't release their knowledge for free."

"I understand."

"No," Seris said quietly. "You don't. But you will."

She led him through the gap in the boarded entrance, into the dusty darkness of the abandoned chapel. And Cassian followed, his heart pounding, toward answers he knew would cost him dearly.
