# Chapter 4: Three Days

Day one of three.

Cassian woke to the sound of hammering.

He stumbled to the window of the counting house and looked out onto the market square. A crew was already at work in the pre-dawn grey, erecting a platform in the square's center. Not a stage for announcements—Cassian recognized the design immediately. A trade post. The kind merchants used for official contracts and witnessed exchanges.

The Hollow's trade post.

They'd said three days. Cassian had assumed that meant three days before they returned. But no—they'd begun immediately. Setting up their apparatus, making themselves visible, letting their presence seep into the town's consciousness.

Smart. Terrifying. But smart.

By the time the sun rose fully, the platform was complete. A simple wooden structure with a desk, two chairs, and a contract ledger bound in black leather. No guards stood watch. No emissary sat waiting. Just the structure itself, promising solutions to anyone desperate enough to approach it.

And people were already gathering to stare.

---

The magistrate called an emergency council meeting before noon.

Cassian wasn't technically on the council—he was just the ledger-keeper—but Torven had summoned "anyone with relevant expertise in contracts and trade negotiations." Translation: anyone who might help him figure out how to weasel out of this situation.

The council chamber was packed. Merchants, guild leaders, the town's wealthiest residents. And one empty chair where the King's representative should have sat. The King's messenger hadn't arrived. Millhaven was on its own.

"We need to discuss terms," Torven began without preamble. "The emissary said we could negotiate. That means there's room for—"

"There's no room." Marcus stood near the back wall, still wearing refugee's rags. Several councilors turned to glare at him for interrupting. "I've seen this before. They offer what they offer. You take it or you don't. There's no middle ground."

"You weren't invited to this meeting," a merchant snapped.

"I've lived through what you're about to experience," Marcus said flatly. "That makes me more qualified than anyone in this room."

Torven waved a hand irritably. "Fine. Stay. But if you're going to speak, please stick to the facts. What exactly did they offer your town?"

"Relief from tax debts. Food for the hungry. Protection from bandits." Marcus's voice was hollow. "Everything they offered you. And the price seemed reasonable: just acknowledge their authority. Sign a document stating our town recognized the Hollow's sovereignty over our lands."

"That's it?" A merchant leaned forward. "Just a signature?"

"That's never it," Cassian said quietly.

All eyes turned to him.

"The document you sign," Cassian continued, "what are the exact terms? Does anyone remember what the emissary said?"

Silence.

"He said we'd have to 'acknowledge their authority,'" Torven said slowly. "And 'accept their terms of fair exchange.' Those were his words."

"What terms?" Cassian pressed. "What specific terms?"

More silence.

"That's the problem," Marcus said. "They don't tell you the full terms until you're ready to sign. Until you're desperate enough that you'll sign anything. And by then—"

The door burst open.

A woman stumbled in, wild-eyed, clutching a piece of parchment. Cassian recognized her—Elara, the baker's wife. Her husband had died in the king's war last year, leaving her with three children and a failing shop.

"Please," she gasped, looking around the room desperately. "I need—someone needs to tell me this is wrong. That I'm being foolish." She held up the parchment, her hands shaking. "The emissary gave me this. He said they can erase my debts. All of them. I won't lose the shop. My children will eat. And the price seems... it seems reasonable. But it can't be. Can it? Please tell me it's a trick. Tell me I'm not seeing this clearly."

Her voice cracked. "Because if it's real—if it's truly as fair as it looks—then I'd be a fool not to sign. And I don't want to be a fool. But I don't want to damn myself either."

Torven stood. "Show me that document."

But Cassian was faster. He crossed the room in three strides and took the parchment gently from Elara's trembling hands. She let him take it, too exhausted to resist.

The contract was beautifully written. Elegant script on expensive vellum. The terms were laid out with perfect legal precision:

*Party of the First Part (Elara of Millhaven) agrees to surrender all outstanding debts, financial obligations, and associated burdens to Party of the Second Part (The Hollow, represented by Emissary Valen). In exchange, Party of the First Part receives freedom from said obligations, guaranteed sustenance for dependent children, and security of home and livelihood.*

*Payment shall be rendered in the form of Service, duration and nature to be determined by Party of the Second Part in accordance with traditional principles of fair exchange. Party of the First Part acknowledges that "Service" may encompass any form of compensation deemed equivalent in value to the relief provided.*

Cassian read it twice. The language was maddeningly vague. "Service" could mean anything. "Equivalent in value" was deliberately undefined. And "traditional principles" meant nothing without knowing which traditions they referred to.

"Don't sign this," Cassian said.

Elara's face crumpled. "But it seems fair. They're taking my debts, I give them service. People do that all the time. Bonded labor, apprenticeships—"

"Look at the payment terms." Cassian pointed to the clause. "It says 'any form of compensation.' Do you understand what that means? They're not specifying what they'll take. It could be labor. Or it could be something else entirely."

"But the emissary explained—he said I'd work for them. Help distribute food to the poor. That's all. He was very clear—"

"Then why isn't it written here?" Cassian demanded. "If that's truly all they want, why doesn't the contract say 'five years of labor' or 'ten hours per week of service'? Why is it vague?"

"I—I don't know."

"It won't save them," Marcus interrupted, his voice hard. "It'll turn you into something that looks like their mother but isn't. You'll feed them, house them, keep them alive. But you won't love them anymore. You won't remember why you ever cared."

"You're lying." But Elara's voice wavered.

"I watched my daughter-in-law sign a contract like this," Marcus said quietly. "She came back from their tent expressionless. Calm. Empty. She couldn't remember her son's name. Couldn't remember she'd ever had a reason to grieve."

Elara looked between them, tears streaming down her face. "But what else can I do? I owe Master Torven six months' rent. I owe the grain merchant. I owe the tax collector. If I don't pay by month's end, they'll take everything anyway."

Every eye in the room turned to Torven.

The magistrate's face had gone carefully neutral. "Business is business. The baker knew the terms when she borrowed."

"You're forcing her into their arms," Cassian said, his voice low and dangerous.

"I'm enforcing contracts. Legal obligations." Torven met his gaze coldly. "Something a ledger-keeper should understand."

The tension in the room was suffocating.

"I'll help you," Cassian said to Elara. "There has to be another way. Give me until tomorrow. Don't sign anything yet."

"Tomorrow?" Elara laughed bitterly. "The first payment is due tomorrow at sundown. Master Torven starts seizing assets the day after. What changes in one day?"

"Let me try."

She stared at him for a long moment. Then, slowly, she took the contract back. "One day," she whispered. "But if you can't help... I'm signing. I won't let my children starve."

She left, still clutching the parchment.

The council erupted in argument the moment the door closed.

"We can't help everyone who's in debt—"

"If we accept the Hollow's terms for the whole town, maybe we can protect individuals—"

"Are you mad? You saw what they did to those refugees—"

"Better them than us!"

Cassian didn't wait to hear more. He left the chamber and walked straight to the market square.

The trade post stood like a tombstone in the morning light.

And sitting behind the desk, as if he'd been waiting all along, was Valen.

---

The emissary looked up as Cassian approached, and his smile was pleasant. Warm, even. Like greeting an old friend.

"Master Cassian. The ledger-keeper who values precision." Valen gestured to the empty chair across from him. "Please. Sit. I was hoping we'd have a chance to speak."

Cassian remained standing. "You knew I'd come."

"You have the look of someone who needs answers." Valen leaned back in his chair. "You've seen the refugees, haven't you? The ones who fled their cities rather than accept our help. They tell you stories. Probably very frightening stories."

"They tell me what you do to people."

"What we *offer* people," Valen corrected. "There's a difference. Every person who signs our contracts does so freely. We explain the terms. We answer questions. We hide nothing. And yet they choose us anyway. Do you know why?"

Cassian didn't answer.

"Because we're honest," Valen said simply. "Your magistrate lies. Your king lies. They promise prosperity and deliver poverty. They promise protection and deliver war. They take your taxes and your sons and give you nothing in return but empty words." He tapped the contract ledger. "We give you exactly what we promise. The trade is always fair."

"You take people's souls."

"We take what they agree to give. And in exchange, they receive relief from suffering they couldn't bear." Valen's expression was earnest, almost sympathetic. "You saw Elara today. Desperate. Drowning in debt. Three children depending on her. Tell me, Master Cassian—what would you have her do? Starve with dignity? Watch her children beg in the streets because she's too proud to accept help?"

"There are other ways to help her."

"Are there?" Valen raised an eyebrow. "Then why haven't you? Why hasn't your magistrate forgiven her debts? Why hasn't your wealthy merchant guild offered loans? Why hasn't your King sent relief?" He leaned forward. "You know why. Because helping costs them something. But condemning her costs nothing. So they'll let her suffer and call it 'personal responsibility.' We, at least, offer her a choice."

"A choice to stop being human."

"A choice to stop *suffering*." Valen's voice was patient, as if explaining something simple to a child. "Humanity is suffering, Master Cassian. Love means loss. Hope means disappointment. Desire means frustration. We offer people freedom from that endless cycle. And they choose it. Gratefully."

Cassian's hands clenched into fists. "You're making evil look like mercy."

"I'm offering desperate people relief from impossible situations." Valen's smile never wavered. "Fair exchange. Informed consent. Balanced scales. The only difference between us and your magistrate is that we deliver what we promise."

"And what did you promise the people of Elara's city? Before you hollowed them out?"

"We promised relief. And we delivered it." Valen opened the ledger, flipped through pages of contracts, each signed in different hands. "Every person who signed these documents knew the terms. Read them carefully. Asked questions. And chose freely. Some regretted it later, yes. But that's the nature of choices, isn't it? We all make trades we regret."

He closed the ledger and met Cassian's gaze.

"Your town has two days left to decide. I hope they choose wisely. I hope they choose us. Because the alternative..." He gestured toward the road where refugees still huddled in their makeshift camp. "The alternative is to run. To flee from town to town, watching the Hollow spread while you pretend there's anywhere left to hide. Or you can stay and fight us. And we'll kill you. Not because we want to, but because you force us to defend what we've built."

"What you've stolen."

"What you've *traded* for." Valen stood, and suddenly his pleasant demeanor cracked just slightly. Beneath it, Cassian saw something cold and vast. "You're young. Inexperienced. You think you can save everyone with good intentions and moral outrage. But you're a child playing in an arena you don't comprehend. Our master has spent decades studying human nature—what people truly want, what they'll give up, how to make surrender look like salvation. He understands the mechanics of human desires better than anyone alive."

He stepped around the desk, moving closer.

"I'm going to tell you something out of professional courtesy, ledger-keeper to ledger-keeper. When the Hollow comes to your town—and it will, whether you sign or not—you have three options. One: Sign. Become one of us. Stop hurting. Two: Run. Flee to the next town and wait for us to arrive there too. Three: Die fighting for a world that was broken long before we arrived to fix it."

"There's a fourth option," Cassian said quietly.

"Oh?"

"Stop you."

Valen laughed. It was genuine, warm, almost fond. "With what? Your determination? Your moral certainty? Your father tried that, you know. He came to our master twenty years ago, convinced he could end the Hollow's spread. Convinced he had the power to unmake what we'd built." The emissary's smile turned sad. "He left broken. Went home to watch his family fall apart while he chased answers he'd never find. Is that the option you're choosing?"

The words hit like physical blows. His father had confronted them. Had tried to stop them. And failed so completely that it destroyed his life.

"Why are you telling me this?" Cassian managed.

"Because I'm trying to help you." Valen's voice was sincere. Painfully sincere. "You seem like a decent man. You care about people. You want to do the right thing. Those are good qualities. Admirable qualities. But they're going to get you killed or broken or hollowed. So I'm offering you mercy."

He held out a piece of parchment. A contract.

"Sign this. Join us. You'll keep your mind, your memories, your sense of self. You'll just stop feeling the pain of watching everything you love crumble. You'll stop caring that the world is cruel. And in return, you'll help us bring peace to others. Fair exchange."

Cassian looked at the contract. At Valen's earnest expression. At the shimmer around the emissary that showed something fundamentally twisted where a human soul should be.

And he understood.

This was the Hollow's true weapon. Not force. Not fear. But *reasonableness*. They made damnation sound like salvation. Made emptiness look like peace. Made the destruction of everything human seem like the only logical choice.

"No," Cassian said.

Valen sighed. "Then you have two days to change your mind. I'll be here when you do."

He sat back down at his desk, pulled out a fresh contract, and began writing. As if Cassian had already left.

As if the conversation was already over.

Cassian walked away, his heart pounding, his mind racing.

Two days to save Elara.

Two days to save his town.

Two days to figure out how to fight an enemy who made evil look like kindness.

---

Day two of three.

Cassian spent the night searching his father's journals for anything—any scrap of information about how Rowan had tried to fight the Hollow. But the entries were fragmented, increasingly desperate. Pages ripped out. Entire sections burned or blacked out with ink. As if his father had been trying to hide his methods even from himself.

One entry, dated twenty years ago, was barely legible:

*Confronted him today. Thought I understood. Thought I could turn it against him. I was wrong. He showed me what he's built—a system where evil is the only logical choice. Where suffering is so great that people BEG to be emptied. And it all appears fair. Legitimate. Because the trades are voluntary.*

*I can't fight him. Can't stop him. All I can do is hide it and hope someone stronger finds it.*

*Emma keeps asking why I'm not sleeping. What can I tell her? That the world is going to destroy itself one desperate trade at a time, and there's nothing I can do to stop it?*

The entry ended there.

His father had given up. Faced Draven Kane and realized he couldn't win.

A knock at the door startled him from his thoughts.

It was Widow Marta from Southgate district—the woman he'd corrected the tax records for in what felt like a lifetime ago. She was holding a basket of bread, her expression carefully neutral.

"Master Cassian. I heard you were trying to help Elara." She set the basket on his desk. "Thought you might need to eat."

"Thank you." Cassian gestured for her to sit, but she remained standing.

"I also came to tell you to stop." Her voice was quiet but firm. "What you're trying to do—it's kind. But it's going to get you killed. Or worse."

"I can't just let her sign that contract."

"Why not?" Marta's expression was tired. "You think you're saving her by delaying the inevitable? The Hollow is coming whether we want them or not. At least if she signs now, she makes the choice herself. Has some control."

"She'll lose everything that makes her who she is."

"And if she doesn't sign, she'll lose her home and her children starve. Is that better? Is suffering with your soul intact somehow more noble than peace without it?" Marta's hands twisted in her apron. "I've been thinking about it. The emissary's offer. For our district. For all of us in Southgate who can barely afford to eat. He says he can erase our debts. Give us work that pays fairly. All we have to do is acknowledge the Hollow's authority."

Cassian stared at her. "You're considering it."

"I'm a widow with two sons, Master Cassian. One is fourteen—conscription age in two years. The King will take him to fight this war. The war against the Hollow. He'll die in some field far from home, and I'll get a letter thanking me for his sacrifice." Her voice cracked. "Or I could sign a paper. Keep my boys safe. Keep food on the table. Is that so wrong?"

"It's not real safety. It's—"

"It's more than the King's offering me." She met his gaze. "You corrected our tax records. You stood up to the magistrate for us. And I'm grateful. But you can't fix this. Nobody can. So maybe... maybe the Hollow's way isn't perfect, but at least it's honest about what it costs."

She left before Cassian could respond.

He sat alone in the counting house, the smell of fresh bread mocking him. From her perspective, from Elara's, from anyone drowning in debt and fear, the Hollow looked like salvation.

Draven Kane had built a system that exploited every failure of the kingdom. Every tax too high, every debt that crushed, every war that took sons. They didn't conquer. They let corruption and desperation do their dirty work.

Cassian pulled out the coin. Something meant to help him understand value. But people's lives had been so devalued that selling their souls looked like a fair trade.

He had to try something. Even if failure destroyed him like it had destroyed his father.

---

He found Marcus in the refugee camp, sitting by a small fire.

"I need to know how to fight them," Cassian said without preamble.

Marcus didn't look up. "You can't."

"My father tried fighting. There must be something—"

"Your father was a fool." Marcus's voice was flat. "I met him. Before he went to confront the Hollow. He came through my city, gathering information. Said he'd found leverage. Wouldn't tell me what." Finally, Marcus looked up. "He came back three months later. Broken. Just kept muttering about 'fairness' and 'balance' like they'd driven him mad with philosophy. By every principle of fair exchange, what they do appears lawful. Monstrous, but lawful." Marcus stood. "You want my advice? Run. Take everyone you care about and go. The Hollow's spreading, but there's still land beyond their reach. Don't waste your life on a fight your father already lost."

"I can't abandon them."

"Then you'll die with them." Marcus turned away. "Your father tried to fight them head-on. It broke him. Sometimes survival means leaving the current battle to fight another day."

Cassian left the camp feeling more hopeless than before.

He walked through the town as twilight deepened, watching people go about their evening routines with forced normality. But he could see the fear beneath the surface. Eyes drifting toward the trade post. Conversations stopping when he passed. Desperate people weighing impossible choices.

How many would sign by tomorrow? How many would choose emptiness over struggle?

He couldn't save everyone. But maybe—maybe—he could save one person.

---

He went to Varon's shop as evening fell.

The old merchant was closing up, pulling shutters over his display windows. He looked up as Cassian approached, and something like resignation crossed his face.

"No," Varon said before Cassian could speak.

"You don't know what I'm going to ask."

"You're going to ask me to forgive Elara's debt. Or loan her money. Or do something charitable that costs me a fortune." Varon continued shuttering windows. "The answer is no. I'm a merchant, not a charity."

"The Hollow is at your door," Cassian said. "If they take this town, what happens to your fortune? Your shop? Everything you've built?"

"They'll honor property rights. The emissary said—"

"The emissary lies." Cassian stepped closer. "Or rather, he tells a truth that hides a larger lie. They'll honor your property. But they'll hollow you out so completely that you won't remember why you wanted property in the first place. You'll own everything and value nothing."

Varon's hands stilled on the shutters.

"Help me save Elara," Cassian said quietly. "Not because it's charity. Because it's survival. Every person who signs with the Hollow makes them stronger. Makes our town weaker. Makes it easier for them to take the next person. And the next. Until they take you."

"And if I help her?" Varon's voice was measured. "If I forgive her debts? What stops the next desperate person from asking? And the next? How many do I save before I've given away everything I have?"

"I don't know." Cassian met his gaze. "But I know what happens if we don't try. I've seen it in the refugees. In the empty guards. In the children who aren't children anymore. If we don't help each other, the Hollow wins by default."

Varon was silent for a long moment.

Then: "What did you give me for the compass?"

Cassian blinked at the non sequitur. "A seed."

"Why did I accept it?"

"Because..." Cassian thought back to that exchange. To the vision he'd had of Varon's lost love. "Because it was worth more to you than money. Because it represented something you'd lost and couldn't buy back."

"Value isn't always measured in coin," Varon said quietly. "You taught me that. Or reminded me, rather." He sighed. "The baker's debt is six months' rent plus interest. Sixty gold crowns. I can forgive the rent. But I can't forgive the coin debt she owes to others. That's beyond my power."

"How much does she owe in total?"

"Perhaps ninety crowns."

Ninety gold crowns. A fortune. More than Cassian could earn in five years.

"I'll find the rest," Cassian said.

Varon's eyebrow rose. "How?"

"I don't know yet. But I'll find it."

The merchant studied him for a long moment. Then, surprisingly, he smiled. It wasn't warm, but it wasn't cruel either. Just tired.

"You're as foolish as your father," Varon said. "Chasing impossible solutions to impossible problems. I suppose that's admirable, in its way." He opened his shop door. "Come in. Let's draft the debt forgiveness before I change my mind."

Inside, Varon's shop smelled of beeswax and old parchment. The merchant lit several lamps, pulled out paper and ink, and began drafting the document. Cassian watched his careful script, hope kindling in his chest for the first time in days.

Maybe he could save her. Maybe one victory would be enough.

"There," Varon said finally, signing with a flourish. "Sixty crowns of debt forgiven, effective immediately. Take it to her in the morning. She'll still owe the other thirty, but at least—"

Footsteps pounded outside. Shouting. A woman's scream—raw and broken.

Cassian and Varon both rushed to the door.

The market square was lit by torches. A crowd had gathered near the trade post, and the sound was coming from the center—a woman keening like an animal in pain.

No. No, it couldn't be—

Cassian ran.

---

He pushed through the crowd and his heart stopped.

Elara knelt on the cobblestones, clutching her eldest daughter. The girl was perhaps eight years old—Cassian had seen her before, bringing her mother's bread deliveries to shops in the square. She'd always had a gap-toothed smile and flour in her hair.

Now she was empty.

The child's eyes were open but unfocused. Her breathing steady. But when Elara shook her, called her name, pleaded—nothing. The girl simply stared at nothing, face slack, presence gone.

"No," Cassian whispered. The debt forgiveness document crumpled in his fist. "No, I was going to—I was going to help—"

A merchant nearby saw him and explained, voice shaking. "The girl came at dusk. Said her mother's first payment was due tomorrow and she needed to help. She had a contract. The emissary signed it. She traded herself."

Cassian felt the world tilt. The girl had heard her mother say it—first payment tomorrow. Had heard Elara crying, heard the desperation in her voice. An eight-year-old trying to save her family the only way she knew how.

He'd been so close. Minutes away from saving them. And now—

"You," Elara's voice cut through his thoughts. She was looking up at him, her face a mask of grief and rage. "You said you'd help. You promised. And while you were negotiating with merchants, my daughter—" Her voice broke. "She heard me crying last night. Heard me say the debts were crushing us. She's eight years old and she thought she had to save me."

"I have the debt forgiveness," Cassian said desperately, holding out the crumpled paper. "Varon agreed. Sixty crowns forgiven. You're—"

"Too late." Elara's voice was dead. "Everything is too late."

Valen's voice came from behind Cassian. The emissary stood at the edge of the crowd, his expression professionally sympathetic. "The child came of her own free will. Explained that her family needed relief from financial burdens. I merely facilitated the exchange she requested."

"She's eight years old!" Cassian roared, spinning to face him. "She can't legally contract! She doesn't understand—"

"She understood perfectly." Valen gestured to the girl calmly. "She knew her mother was suffering. Knew the family faced ruin. So she offered what she had: herself. Her essence in exchange for her family's security. We accepted the trade. Age doesn't determine value."

"She's a child! She heard her mother's words and panicked—"

"And acted with more courage than most adults." Valen's expression remained professionally sympathetic. "The debts are real. The suffering is real. I simply accepted the solution she offered." He brushed imaginary dust from his sleeve. "Your town has until sundown tomorrow to give your answer. Accept our terms, or face our armies."

He looked directly at Cassian, and for just a moment, his pleasant mask slipped. Beneath it was something cold and vast and utterly without mercy.

"You tried to save one woman, ledger-keeper. And failed. How do you think you'll fare trying to save an entire town?"

He walked away, leaving Elara sobbing over her daughter's empty shell, and Cassian standing with a useless piece of paper in his hand.

---

The town meeting that afternoon felt like attending a funeral where the corpse was still breathing.

Cassian stood near the back of the packed hall, pressed between bodies that radiated heat and fear-sweat. The air was thick and close, heavy with the smell of unwashed wool and desperation. Someone had opened the high windows, but no breeze came through—the afternoon was still and oppressive, as if the world itself was holding its breath.

Elara stood in the center of the hall, holding her hollow daughter by the hand. The girl stood placidly, staring at nothing. And Elara said nothing. Just looked at the assembled crowd with dead eyes that said everything.

*This is what hesitation costs. This is what happens when you wait for someone else to save you.*

Half the town wanted to fight. Voices rose in anger, fists pounded tables. "We can't let this stand!" the blacksmith roared, his face red. "That monster stole a child!"

"He didn't steal anything," Magistrate Torven said from his seat at the front, his voice carrying the cold weight of authority. "The girl signed a legal contract. Under our laws—"

"Damn the laws!" The blacksmith shot to his feet. "Are we really going to hide behind legal technicalities while children are hollowed out in front of us?"

"What would you have us do?" a merchant countered, his voice shrill with fear. "Fight? With what army? What weapons? We'll be slaughtered!"

"Better dead than hollow!"

"Easy for you to say—you don't have children depending on you!"

The shouting escalated. Accusations flew. Families who'd been neighbors for generations turned on each other. Cassian watched a lifetime of community trust shatter like glass dropped on stone.

This was what the Hollow did. Not conquest by force, but by division. By making people so afraid and desperate that they tore each other apart before the enemy ever drew a sword.

And through it all, Cassian stood silent, the crumpled debt forgiveness still in his pocket.

Minutes too late. Minutes.

The thought came unbidden: maybe Valen was right. Maybe the only choice left was to stop fighting. Sign the contract. Stop feeling.

The appeal of that thought terrified him more than anything else.

"Cassian."

He looked up. Seris stood at the back of the hall, barely visible in the shadows. She gestured for him to follow, then slipped out the door.

He followed her into the alley behind the town hall. She was waiting, her expression grim.

"You're losing," she said without preamble.

"I know."

"Your town is going to fall. Tonight, tomorrow, a week from now—it doesn't matter. The Hollow has already won. You're just delaying the inevitable."

"Then why are you here?"

"Because you still have a choice to make. And you need information before you make it." Seris glanced back toward the chaos of the town meeting. "Your father tried to fight the Hollow twenty years ago. He failed because he didn't understand what he was facing. Didn't understand the power they wield or how they corrupted it."

"And you do?"

"No. But I can take you to someone who does." She met his gaze. "There's a place beneath this town. Older than Millhaven. Older than the kingdom itself. Your father went there once, seeking answers. He found some, but not enough. Maybe you'll have better luck."

Cassian felt a chill run down his spine. "What kind of place?"

"The kind where secret trades are made. Trades that don't see the light of day." Seris turned away. "Meet me at the old chapel tonight. Midnight. I'll take you there. What you learn might give you a chance—a slim one—of understanding what you're up against." She paused at the mouth of the alley. "Or it might convince you that running is the only sane option. Either way, you'll know the truth."

"Who is this person? How do they know about the Hollow?"

"Questions that will be answered—if you're willing to pay the price." Her expression was grim. 

"What price? What should I bring?"

"Nothing you could carry would be enough." Seris met his gaze steadily. "The trade will not be in coins or goods. It's deeper than that. More permanent. If you want answers, be prepared to give up something you can't get back."

"Then what—"

"Just come. And come willing to trade. That's all I can tell you." Before Cassian could ask more, she disappeared into the night.

---

The rest of the day passed in a blur of dread and indecision.

Cassian tried to work, to focus on ledgers and numbers, but his mind kept returning to Seris's words. A place beneath the town. Trades that went deeper than coin. Something he couldn't get back.

What was she taking him to?

By evening, the town had reached a breaking point. Groups formed in the square, arguing. Some wanted to accept the Hollow's terms. Others wanted to flee. A few—very few—talked about fighting.

Cassian watched from the counting house window as Widow Marta approached the trade post. She stood there for long minutes, staring at it, her hands twisted in her apron. Then, slowly, she turned away and walked back toward Southgate.

Not today. But tomorrow? How many tomorrows did anyone have left?

As night fell, Cassian made his decision.

He would go with Seris. Would see this place beneath the town. Would learn what his father had learned—or failed to learn.

Because the alternative was standing here paralyzed, watching his town die by degrees.

He touched the coin in his pocket. Whatever price this mysterious person demanded, he'd find a way to pay it.

Though Seris's warning echoed in his mind: *Nothing you could carry would be sufficient.*

What could be taken from him that he couldn't carry? The question haunted him as midnight approached.

The thought made his stomach turn. Was this person—this Dealer—the same as the Hollow? Would he have to become hollow himself just to learn how to fight them?

If the price was acceptable, he'd pay it. If it was too terrible to pay... he would have decide when he got there.

Midnight found him at the old chapel.

The building loomed against the starless sky, its broken roof like jagged teeth. Cassian had passed it a thousand times, barely noticing it—just another relic of the town's past, slowly crumbling into forgotten history.

Now it looked ominous. Expectant.

Seris emerged from the shadows by the entrance. "You came."

"Did you think I wouldn't?"

"I thought you might choose ignorance. It's often easier." She gestured toward the chapel. "Last chance to turn back. Once we go down, there's no leaving without paying the price. The old powers don't release their knowledge for free."

"I understand."

"No," Seris said quietly. "You don't. But you will."

She led him through the gap in the boarded entrance, into the dusty darkness of the abandoned chapel. And Cassian followed, his heart pounding, toward answers he knew would cost him dearly.
