# Chapter 18: The Thread Between Minds

The connection was fragile—like hearing a voice through walls and water, distant but unmistakable.

*...Cassian?*

Cassian's heart lurched. He focused harder on the thread, pouring his awareness along its length. The Coin of Heads burned hot in his palm, responding to his desperate need.

*Mira. I can hear you. Where are you?*

Silence. The thread wavered, threatening to dissolve.

Then, fainter than before: *Underground. Stone walls. Three levels down, he said. I can see... bars on a window. Sunlight but I can't reach it.*

*Who has you? Veylin?*

*No. She brought me here but... Draven. He's here. He showed me—*

The connection fractured. Cassian felt Mira's presence recede like a tide pulling back from shore. He pushed harder, trying to maintain contact, but something was interfering. Another presence, cold and calculating, pressing against the thread.

And then, cutting through the static like a blade:

*Hello, Cassian.*

Draven's voice. Smooth, cultured, utterly in control.

Cassian's eyes snapped open. He was back in his quarters, heart pounding, the coin hot enough to burn. Sweat soaked his shirt.

The thread was still there—thinner now, barely perceptible. But along it, he could sense Draven's awareness. Not speaking, just... watching. Evaluating. Amused.

*He knows I can reach her,* Cassian realized. *He wanted me to make contact. This is part of his plan.*

But the connection had worked. For a few seconds, he'd touched Mira's mind. Heard her thoughts. And more importantly, she'd shared location details: underground, three levels, barred window facing sunlight.

It wasn't much. But it was something.

Cassian stood, tucking both coins into his shirt, and went to find the King.

---

King Aldric's study was dimly lit, the King hunched over maps of the capital with Captain Drenneth. They both looked up when Cassian entered.

"I made contact with her," Cassian said without preamble. "Through the coins. I can sense her location—or at least narrow it down."

Drenneth straightened immediately. "How precise?"

"Underground facility, three levels deep, with a barred window that catches sunlight. Somewhere in the city."

"That describes half a dozen locations," Drenneth said, already moving to a different map—this one showing the capital's underground infrastructure. "Could be the old merchant vaults beneath Guild Row. Or the wine cellars under the noble quarter. Or—"

"The aqueduct terminus," the King interrupted, pointing to a location on the northern edge of the city. "It's been abandoned for twenty years. Three levels of storage chambers, most with small ventilation windows that catch morning light." He looked at Cassian. "Draven used it as a meeting place once before—we found evidence after he'd already left."

Cassian felt the thread pulse faintly. He couldn't tell if it was confirmation or just his own desperate hope, but something about the location felt right.

"How many guards?" Cassian asked.

"If it's the terminus? Could be anywhere from twenty to a hundred." Drenneth's expression was grim. "The facility is massive—easily defensible, multiple exits, designed to withstand siege. If Draven's fortified it properly, we'd need a full company to breach it safely."

"Which would take time to organize," the King said. "And alert every Hollow sympathizer in the city that we're coming."

"So we don't breach it," Cassian said. "I go in quietly. Find Mira. Extract her before anyone realizes I'm there."

Both men stared at him.

"That's suicide," Drenneth said flatly. "You're barely recovered from the last extraction. You have no intelligence about the interior layout. And Draven is almost certainly waiting for exactly this response."

"I know." Cassian met his eyes. "But it's also my only option. If I wait for perfect intelligence, for optimal conditions, Draven will have already broken her or moved her somewhere I can't track."

"Or killed her," Drenneth said. "Have you considered that? That she's bait for a trap, and the moment you commit, he springs it?"

"Of course I've considered it." Cassian's voice was tight. "But I'm going anyway. With or without your support."

The King studied him for a long moment, then nodded slowly. "I thought you'd say that."

"Then help me," Cassian said. "Your intelligence network—has anyone tracked where Draven might be operating from? Where he'd take prisoners?"

Drenneth moved back to the map. "We've had reports of increased activity around the old aqueduct terminus. It's been abandoned for twenty years, but—"

"That's where I met him before," Cassian interrupted. "When Mira..." He didn't finish. "He knows the layout. Probably fortified it."

"Which makes it a terrible place for a rescue," Drenneth said. "Multiple levels, dozens of rooms, easily defended."

"But predictable," the King said thoughtfully. "Draven is methodical. He wouldn't move a high-value prisoner without preparation. If she's there, she'll be in one of the lower holding chambers—the ones with the ventilation windows."

Cassian felt the thread to Mira pulse faintly, as if confirming it.

"I need information," he said, thinking aloud. "Not about the location—I can find her. But about Draven himself. What he's planning. What he really wants."

He looked at the King. "The Royal Library—does it have records on the coins? Ancient artifacts? Anything about the Law of Balance?"

Aldric's expression shifted slightly. "The deep archives have some materials. Mostly legends, fragmentary histories. When my father was alive, he spent considerable time there, researching. He became... obsessed with a particular section. Sealed it off, actually."

Cassian's pulse quickened. His father had sealed research about the coins. Research important enough to lock away.

"I need access to those archives," Cassian said.

"The library is open. The archives are three levels down, accessible through the north stairwell. But I should warn you—whatever my father found troubled him greatly."

The King walked to his desk and wrote something on a piece of parchment. "This grants you access to the restricted sections. The head archivist will show you to my father's sealed chamber."

Cassian took the parchment, folding it carefully.

Two paths. He could go to the archives now, learn what his father discovered, gain knowledge that might be crucial. Or he could go after Mira immediately, before Draven had more time to manipulate her.

Wisdom or action. Knowledge or compassion.

The Coin of Heads pulsed against his chest, warm and insistent.

"We need to split up," Cassian said suddenly.

Drenneth frowned. "What do you mean?"

"Torin." Cassian turned to the King. "Is he still here? In the palace?"

"East wing. With Perin and Elena."

"Send for him. Now."

Ten minutes later, Torin arrived—expressionless as ever, but there was a sharpness in his eyes that hadn't been there before. The partial restoration was holding. He was still damaged, but present.

"Torin," Cassian said. "I need you to do something for me. Something important."

"Specify."

Cassian handed him the parchment. "Take this to the Royal Library. Go to the deep archives, three levels down. There's a sealed chamber—my father's research. I need you to find it, study everything inside, and report back with anything that might help us stop Draven. Particularly anything about multiple coins or a crown."

Torin took the key, studying it with the same analytical focus he applied to everything. "Time frame?"

"I'll give you until tomorrow morning. I'm going after Mira tonight."

"Probability of success?"

"Low," Cassian admitted. "But I have to try."

Torin nodded once. "Logical. You're emotionally compromised regarding Mira's safety. Separating intelligence gathering from rescue operation reduces risk of both failing simultaneously. I'll complete the research assignment."

"Thank you."

"Don't thank me. This is function. Not favor." But something flickered in Torin's eyes—brief, barely there. "But... Mira asked me to protect you once. If this helps you survive..."

He left without another word, the parchment and bloody handkerchief clutched in his mechanical grip.

Drenneth watched him go, then turned to Cassian. "You're really doing this."

"Yes."

"Then at least let me give you support. I'll position a squad near the terminus—out of sight, but close enough to intervene if things go wrong."

"Draven will sense them."

"Probably. But he'll also know that killing you will bring the full weight of royal forces down on his head. It might make him hesitate."

Cassian considered, then nodded. "All right. But they stay back unless I signal. I won't risk your soldiers being hollowed because of my rescue attempt."

"Agreed." Drenneth moved to the map, marking positions. "We'll set up here, here, and here. If you need us, light a signal flare. We'll breach within minutes."

The King walked Cassian to the door. "Your father would be proud," he said quietly. "Not because you're risking everything for someone you care about—that's just human. But because you're doing it while still trying to protect others. That's wisdom."

"Or stupidity," Cassian said.

"Often the same thing, in the moment." The King's smile was sad. "Good luck, Cassian. Bring her back safely. And yourself, if possible."

---

Cassian left the palace as the sun touched the western horizon, slipping out through a servant's entrance to avoid attention. The city was settling into evening—shops closing, lanterns being lit, people heading home for dinner.

He moved through the streets with practiced invisibility, just another clerk heading home late. But his mind was racing, the coins burning against his chest.

The thread to Mira was still there. Thinner now, barely perceptible. But present.

As he walked, Cassian risked reaching out again, gently probing the connection.

*Mira? Can you hear me?*

Silence. Then, so faint he almost missed it:

*He knows. Cassian, he knows you're coming. He's been... talking to me. About the coins. About you. He showed me something. A crown. Seven empty settings. He wants to—*

Draven's presence slammed into the connection like a hammer.

*Enough.*

The thread went dark. Not severed, but blocked. Draven's will pressing down on it like a hand covering a flame.

Cassian stumbled, catching himself against a wall. Several passersby glanced at him curiously, then hurried on.

He took a shuddering breath. The connection was still there—he could feel it beneath Draven's interference. But he couldn't reach Mira anymore. Not without confronting Draven directly.

*Fine,* Cassian thought. *If that's what it takes.*

He continued north, toward the old aqueduct terminus.

---

The terminus rose from the northern district like a monument to abandoned ambition—three stories of weathered stone, arched entrances long since bricked over, windows dark and empty. Weeds grew between the paving stones of the surrounding courtyard.

Cassian circled the perimeter from a distance, using the Coin of Heads to perceive the building's value patterns.

And there—faint but unmistakable—the shimmer of human presence inside. Multiple people. At least twenty, maybe more. Most of them concentrated on the lower levels, precisely where Mira had said she was being held.

But there was something else. A stronger presence, higher up. On the roof, perhaps, or just below it. Watching. Waiting.

Draven.

Cassian could feel him now that he was close enough—a distortion in the normal flow of value, like a stone creating ripples in a stream. The man's very existence bent the Law around him.

*He knows I'm here,* Cassian realized. *He's been waiting.*

For a moment, he considered retreating. Calling for Drenneth's forces, mounting a proper assault, approaching this with strategy instead of desperation.

But the thread to Mira pulsed weakly, and he could feel her fear along it. Distant, muted by Draven's interference, but real.

*No more waiting.*

Cassian found the eastern loading dock entrance—exactly where Drenneth's intelligence had predicted—and slipped inside.

The interior was dark, lit only by occasional oil lamps placed at intersections. The air smelled of damp stone and rust. Cassian moved quietly through the corridors, guided by the shimmer of human presence below.

Down one level. Two. Three.

At the third level, the corridor opened into a storage chamber—and there, in a cell formed by iron bars, was Mira.

She looked up as he approached, her eyes widening. For a moment, pure relief flooded her face. Then horror.

"Cassian, run! It's a—"

"Trap?" a voice finished smoothly.

Cassian spun.

Draven Kane stood at the corridor entrance, backlit by lamplight. Cassian recognized him instantly from the aqueduct—the same handsome severity, the same impeccable bearing, the same air of absolute control. Around his neck hung the golden locket, and from it Cassian could sense the familiar presence of the Coin of Oxen, pulsing with restrained power.

"Hello again, Cassian," Draven said, his voice cultured and warm. "I knew you'd come. We have so much more to discuss than our last conversation allowed."

Behind him, figures emerged from the shadows. Not guards. Hollow. Their eyes empty, their movements synchronized. Twenty of them, blocking the only exit.

Cassian reached for his coins, but Draven raised a hand.

"Please. There's no need for violence. I have no intention of harming you." He smiled. "In fact, I've been looking forward to this conversation for quite some time. You and I, Cassian, are more alike than you realize."

"I'm nothing like you," Cassian said.

"Aren't you?" Draven walked closer, his steps measured and confident. "You use the coins to perceive value, to broker trades, to take from one and give to another. You've learned to sever the hollow from my network—a skill I didn't expect anyone to develop. The only difference between us is that I've been more ambitious. More willing to see the work through to its conclusion."

He gestured to Mira's cell. "She told you I showed her the crown, I assume? The Crown of Aram. Seven medallions, seven domains of power. I have two coins now—Oxen, which you've seen, and Waters, which I acquired last year. You have two as well—Heads and Seeds. The remaining three are scattered across the kingdoms, but I'm narrowing down their locations."

Cassian's mind raced. Two coins. Draven had bonded with two, just like him.

"How?" Cassian demanded.

"I make them submit. Oxen dominates the others. Bends them to my will."

He touched the locket gently. "When I claim all seven..." His eyes gleamed. "I'll have power beyond anything this world has seen in a thousand years."

"To do what?" Cassian demanded. "Rule? Conquer?"

"To *fix*." Draven's voice was fervent. "This world is broken, Cassian. People suffer because resources are scarce, because power is concentrated, because the Law of Balance punishes the weak and rewards the ruthless. But with all seven coins unified in the crown, I can reshape the fundamental rules of exchange. Make abundance universal. Make suffering a choice rather than an inevitability. Create a world where no one needs to trade away their humanity just to survive."

"By hollowing them first," Cassian said. "By making them empty so you can fill them with whatever you want them to be."

"By offering them a choice," Draven corrected. "Accept the trade—suffering for peace—or keep struggling. Most choose peace. And who am I to deny them?"

"They don't understand what they're giving up," Cassian said. "You manipulate them into accepting."

"I offer clarity. The Law accepts their consent. That's all that matters." Draven's smile widened. "But I didn't bring you here to debate philosophy. We both know you can't stop me through force. Your little escape at the aqueduct was impressive, but temporary. I still have my network. Still have thousands who've accepted my vision."

"I offer clarity. The Law accepts their consent. That's all that matters." Draven's smile widened. "But I didn't bring you here to debate philosophy. We both know you can't stop me through force. Your little escape at the aqueduct was impressive, but temporary. I still have my network. Still have thousands who've accepted my vision."

He paused. "Your father understood that, eventually. Eight years ago, he discovered I was collecting the coins. He tried to convince me to stop. When I refused, he challenged me." His expression darkened. "The Coin of Oxen grants me strength beyond mortal limits. Your father fought bravely, but the Law chose the stronger combatant. It always does."

Cassian's blood went cold. "You killed my father."

"The Law killed your father," Draven said quietly. "I simply survived. He attacked me knowing the risk. Hoping, I think, that conviction would overcome raw power. It didn't."

Rage surged through Cassian, hot and overwhelming. He reached for both coins, prepared to—

"Stop."

Draven's command wasn't loud, but it carried absolute authority. And simultaneously, Cassian felt pressure through the thread to Mira—not pain, but a warning.

Mira's breath caught, her eyes widening.

"The connection you forged with her," Draven said calmly, "runs both ways. I can sense it. I lack your coin's particular gift for manipulating minds, but I can use the Coin of Waters to affect her through that thread. Drown her lungs. Stop her heart. Unless you cooperate."

Cassian froze, his hand hovering over the coins.

"Better." Draven smiled. "Now. Here's my offer. You have two coins. I have two. Together, we have four of the seven. We're both searching for the remaining three. We could fight—waste time, resources, lives—trying to claim them separately. Or we could cooperate. Pool our knowledge. Find the last three coins together, then decide how to use them."

"I would never help you," Cassian said.

"Even to save her?" Draven gestured to Mira. "I'm offering you time, Cassian. Time to convince me of your perspective. Time to try to find another solution. Time to protect the people you care about. All you have to do is agree to a temporary truce. Stop interfering with my operations. Help me locate the final two coins. And in exchange, I'll release Mira unharmed and spare your resistance network from retaliation."

"And after we find the coins?"

"Then we negotiate. Perhaps you'll convince me that suffering has value. Perhaps I'll convince you that peace is worth the price." Draven's smile widened. "Or perhaps we'll discover the Law has a different plan for us both."

Cassian looked past him to Mira. She was staring at him, shaking her head frantically. *Don't,* she mouthed. *Don't trust him.*

But Draven's hand was resting lightly on the locket, and through the thread, Cassian could feel the threat hovering over Mira like a blade. One command from Draven, and she would die.

"Twenty-four hours," Cassian said quietly. "I'll consider your offer. But I need time to think."

"Of course." Draven inclined his head. "You have until sunset tomorrow. Meet me at the old mill outside the eastern gate—neutral ground. We'll discuss this properly, without the pressure of immediate danger." He smiled. "I believe in good faith negotiations, Cassian. I'm not a monster. Just someone willing to do what's necessary."

He stepped aside, gesturing to the corridor. "You're free to go. And Cassian? I truly hope you'll see reason. We could accomplish so much together. Far more than your father ever dreamed."

Cassian forced himself to walk past Draven, past the hollow guards, back toward the stairs. Every instinct screamed at him to fight, to try to free Mira now, to use the coins to—

But Draven had two coins. Had the power to kill Mira through their connection. Had twenty hollow guards and who knew how many more throughout the city.

This wasn't a fight Cassian could win. Not yet.

As he climbed the stairs, he heard Draven's voice echoing up from below:

"Until tomorrow, Cassian. The mill at sunset. And please—do bring both coins. I'd hate for our negotiation to begin with mistrust."

Cassian emerged into the night air and ran.

---

He made it three blocks before collapsing in an alley, his whole body shaking. The coins were hot against his chest, burning with frustrated power.

*I left her there,* he thought. *I just left her in his hands.*

But what choice did he have? Fight and watch her be hollowed? Refuse and let Draven kill her to make a point?

The thread to Mira pulsed weakly. Through it, he could sense her fear. Her confusion. Her desperate hope that he had some kind of plan.

He didn't. Not yet.

But tomorrow, Torin would return with whatever knowledge his father had sealed away. Tomorrow, he'd meet Draven at the mill, with a better understanding of what he was truly facing.

Tomorrow, one way or another, this would end.

Cassian touched the coins through his shirt and made a silent promise:

*I'm coming back for you, Mira. I don't know how yet. But I'm coming back.*

And far away, through the fragile thread that connected their minds, he felt her answer:

*I know. Just... be careful. He's not lying about the coins. I felt his power when he threatened me. And the crown—I saw it, Cassian. It's real. Seven empty settings, waiting.*

The thread faded as Draven's presence reasserted control.

Cassian stood, steadying himself, and headed back toward the palace.

He had one day to find a way to save Mira, stop Draven, and prevent a man with three coins from claiming the power to reshape reality itself.

One day.

It would have to be enough.
