# Chapter 18: The Thread Between Minds

The connection was fragile—like hearing a voice through walls and water, distant but unmistakable.

*...Cassian?*

Cassian's heart lurched. He focused harder on the thread, pouring his awareness along its length. The Coin of Heads burned hot in his palm, responding to his desperate need.

*Mira. I can hear you. Where are you?*

Silence. The thread wavered, threatening to dissolve.

Then, fainter than before: *Underground. Stone walls. Three levels down, he said. I can see... bars on a window. Sunlight but I can't reach it.*

*Who has you? Veylin?*

*No. She brought me here but... Draven. He's here. He showed me—*

The connection fractured. Cassian felt Mira's presence recede like a tide pulling back from shore. He pushed harder, trying to maintain contact, but something was interfering. Another presence, cold and calculating, pressing against the thread.

And then, cutting through the static like a blade:

*Hello, Cassian.*

Draven's voice. Smooth, cultured, utterly in control.

Cassian's eyes snapped open. He was back in his quarters, heart pounding, the coin hot enough to burn. Sweat soaked his shirt.

The thread was still there—thinner now, barely perceptible. But along it, he could sense Draven's awareness. Not speaking, just... watching. Evaluating. Amused.

*He knows I can reach her,* Cassian realized. *He wanted me to make contact. This is part of his plan.*

But the connection had worked. For a few seconds, he'd touched Mira's mind. Heard her thoughts. And more importantly, she'd shared location details: underground, three levels, barred window facing sunlight.

It wasn't much. But it was something.

Cassian stood, tucking both coins into his shirt, and went to find the King.

---

King Aldric's study was dimly lit, the King hunched over maps of the capital with Captain Drenneth. They both looked up when Cassian entered.

"I made contact with her," Cassian said without preamble. "Through the coins. Mira's alive and conscious. She gave me details about her location."

Drenneth straightened immediately. "How precise?"

"Underground facility, three levels deep, with a barred window that catches sunlight. Stone walls. She said 'he brought her there'—meaning someone moved her from wherever Veylin initially handed her over."

"That describes half a dozen locations in the city," Drenneth said, already moving to a different map—this one showing the city's underground infrastructure. "Old merchant vaults beneath Guild Row. Wine cellars under the noble quarter. The grain storage beneath the eastern market. The abandoned—"

"Wait." Cassian closed his eyes, focusing on the thread to Mira. It was faint, but present. He let the Coin of Heads guide his perception, following the connection like a strand of spider silk stretching across the city. "I can sense direction. She's... north. North and slightly east from here."

He opened his eyes, moving to the map. "Here. Somewhere in this quadrant."

Drenneth traced the area with his finger. "That narrows it to three possibilities. The old aqueduct terminus, the wine merchant's vault, or the northern watchtower basement." He glanced at the King. "We've had reports of unusual activity around the aqueduct for the past week. Hollow moving in and out at odd hours."

The King's expression darkened. "The aqueduct terminus. It's been abandoned for twenty years, but..." He touched a point on the map. "Draven used it as a meeting place once before. Three months ago. We found evidence after he'd already left—signs that he'd been operating there for a while."

Cassian felt the thread pulse faintly, as if in confirmation. "That's it," he said. "That's where she is."

"How many guards?" Cassian asked.

"If it's the terminus? Could be anywhere from twenty to a hundred." Drenneth's expression was grim. "The facility is massive—easily defensible, multiple exits, designed to withstand siege. If Draven's fortified it properly, we'd need a full company to breach it safely."

"Which would take time to organize," the King said. "And alert every Hollow sympathizer in the city that we're coming."

"So we don't breach it," Cassian said. "I go in quietly. Find Mira. Extract her before anyone realizes I'm there."

Both men stared at him.

"That's suicide," Drenneth said flatly. "You're barely recovered from the last extraction. You have no intelligence about the interior layout. And Draven is almost certainly waiting for exactly this response."

"I know." Cassian met his eyes. "But it's also my only option. If I wait for perfect intelligence, for optimal conditions, Draven will have already broken her or moved her somewhere I can't track."

"Or killed her," Drenneth said. "Have you considered that? That she's bait for a trap, and the moment you commit, he springs it?"

"Of course I've considered it." Cassian's voice was tight. "But I'm going anyway. With or without your support."

The King studied him for a long moment, then nodded slowly. "I thought you'd say that."

"Then help me," Cassian said. "Your intelligence network—has anyone tracked where Draven might be operating from? Where he'd take prisoners?"

Drenneth moved back to the map. "We've had reports of increased activity around the old aqueduct terminus. It's been abandoned for twenty years, but—"

"That's where I met him before," Cassian interrupted. "When Mira..." He didn't finish. "He knows the layout. Probably fortified it."

"Which makes it a terrible place for a rescue," Drenneth said. "Multiple levels, dozens of rooms, easily defended."

"But predictable," the King said thoughtfully. "Draven is methodical. He wouldn't move a high-value prisoner without preparation. If she's there, she'll be in one of the lower holding chambers—the ones with the ventilation windows."

Cassian felt the thread to Mira pulse faintly, as if confirming it.

"I need information," he said, thinking aloud. "Not about the location—I can find her. But about Draven himself. What he's planning. What he really wants."

He looked at the King. "The Royal Library—does it have records on the coins? Ancient artifacts? Anything about the Law of Balance?"

Aldric's expression shifted slightly. "The deep archives have some materials. Mostly legends, fragmentary histories. My father spent considerable time in those archives, researching the coins. When I was young, I remember him disappearing down there for days at a time, coming back exhausted, troubled. Eventually he sealed off an entire section—said the knowledge was too dangerous to leave accessible."

Cassian's pulse quickened. His father had sealed research about the coins. Research important enough to lock away.

"I need access to those archives," Cassian said.

"Normally, I'd insist on accompanying you. But we don't have time for normal procedures." The King walked to his desk and wrote something on a piece of parchment. "This grants you access to the restricted sections. The head archivist will show you to my father's sealed chamber. But I should warn you—whatever he found troubled him greatly. Changed him, in his final years."

Cassian took the parchment, folding it carefully. Then a thought struck him.

"Torin," he said. "Where is he? Still in the palace?"

"East wing. With Perin and Elena. Why?"

Because Cassian couldn't be in two places at once. Couldn't research his father's discoveries while also preparing to infiltrate the aqueduct terminus. And Torin—damaged but functional, analytical to a fault—might be the perfect person to dig through complex historical research.

Ten minutes later, Torin arrived—expressionless as ever, but there was a sharpness in his eyes that hadn't been there before. The partial restoration was holding. He was still damaged, but present.

"Torin," Cassian said. "I need you to do something for me. Something important."

"Specify."

Cassian handed him the parchment. "Take this to the Royal Library. Go to the deep archives, three levels down. There's a sealed chamber—my father's research. I need you to find it, study everything inside, and report back with anything that might help us stop Draven. Particularly anything about multiple coins or a crown."

Torin took the key, studying it with the same analytical focus he applied to everything. "Time frame?"

"I'll give you until tomorrow morning. I'm going after Mira tonight."

"Probability of success?"

"Low," Cassian admitted. "But I have to try."

Torin was quiet for a moment, processing. Then: "Logical division of labor. You're emotionally compromised regarding Mira's safety. Attempting both intelligence gathering and rescue operation simultaneously would reduce effectiveness of both. Separation increases overall probability of positive outcome."

"Exactly," Cassian said, relieved Torin understood.

"I'll complete the research assignment." Torin turned to leave, then paused. Something flickered in his eyes—brief, barely there. "Mira asked me to protect you once. After the restoration. If this research helps you survive the confrontation with Draven..."

He didn't finish the sentence, but he didn't need to.

"Thank you, Torin."

"Don't thank me." But the flicker in his eyes suggested otherwise. He left without another word, the parchment clutched in his mechanical grip.

Drenneth watched him go, then turned to Cassian. "You're really doing this."

"Yes."

"Then at least let me give you support. I'll position a squad near the terminus—out of sight, but close enough to intervene if things go wrong."

Cassian shook his head. "Draven will sense them. He'll know I didn't come alone, and it'll give him an excuse to refuse any negotiation. Or worse—activate his Hollow network immediately as retaliation."

"So you're going completely alone? Into a fortified position held by a man with two coins and an army of Hollow?" Drenneth's expression was grim. "That's suicide, Cassian."

"Maybe. But it's the only approach that might work." Cassian met his eyes. "Draven wants to talk. To recruit me, or at least convince me his vision is right. If I show up with soldiers at my back, I'm proving I'm already his enemy. If I come alone, I'm showing I'm willing to listen—even if it's a lie."

The King nodded slowly. "There's wisdom in that. Draven respects power, but he values converts more. Someone who chooses to join him willingly is worth more to his cause than another Hollow servant."

"Exactly," Cassian said. "So I go alone. I listen. I learn what I can. And I buy time for Torin to finish researching whatever your father discovered."

Drenneth didn't look happy, but he nodded. "At least take a signal flare. If everything goes wrong, light it. I'll have people watching from a distance—far enough that Draven won't sense them as a threat, close enough to see a flare. They won't be able to breach and extract you, but they can create a distraction. Give you a chance to run."

"All right," Cassian agreed. "That's reasonable."

Drenneth retrieved a small cylindrical device from a cabinet—about the size of a writing quill, capped with red wax. "Break the seal, point it skyward, and it'll burn bright enough to see from half the city. After that, you'll have maybe five minutes before my people arrive. Use them wisely."

Cassian tucked the flare into his coat pocket.

The King walked Cassian to the door. "Your father would be proud," he said quietly. "Not because you're risking everything for someone you care about—that's just human. But because you're doing it while still trying to protect others. That's wisdom."

"Or stupidity," Cassian said.

"Often the same thing, in the moment." The King's smile was sad. "Good luck, Cassian. Bring her back safely. And yourself, if possible."

---

Cassian left the palace as the sun touched the western horizon, slipping out through a servant's entrance to avoid attention. The city was settling into evening—shops closing, lanterns being lit, people heading home for dinner.

He moved through the streets with practiced invisibility, just another clerk heading home late. But his mind was racing, the coins burning against his chest.

The thread to Mira was still there. Thinner now, barely perceptible. But present.

As he walked, Cassian risked reaching out again, gently probing the connection.

*Mira? Can you hear me?*

Silence. Then, so faint he almost missed it:

*He knows. Cassian, he knows you're coming. He's been... talking to me. About the coins. About you. He showed me something. A crown. Seven empty settings. He wants to—*

Draven's presence slammed into the connection like a hammer.

*Enough.*

The thread went dark. Not severed, but blocked. Draven's will pressing down on it like a hand covering a flame.

Cassian stumbled, catching himself against a wall. Several passersby glanced at him curiously, then hurried on.

He took a shuddering breath. The connection was still there—he could feel it beneath Draven's interference. But he couldn't reach Mira anymore. Not without confronting Draven directly.

*Fine,* Cassian thought. *If that's what it takes.*

He continued north, toward the old aqueduct terminus.

---

The terminus rose from the northern district like a monument to abandoned ambition—three stories of weathered stone, arched entrances long since bricked over, windows dark and empty. Weeds grew between the paving stones of the surrounding courtyard.

Cassian circled the perimeter from a distance, using the Coin of Heads to perceive the building's value patterns.

And there—faint but unmistakable—the shimmer of human presence inside. Multiple people. At least twenty, maybe more. Most of them concentrated on the lower levels, precisely where Mira had said she was being held.

But there was something else. A stronger presence, higher up. On the third level, near what had once been the main reservoir chamber. Watching. Waiting. The value signature was unlike anything Cassian had felt before—dense, almost oppressive, like gravity itself had weight.

Draven.

Cassian could feel him now that he was close enough—a distortion in the normal flow of value, like a stone creating ripples in a stream. The man's very existence bent the Law around him, pulling resources toward himself while distributing costs outward to his network.

*He knows I'm here,* Cassian realized. *He's been waiting. This could be a trap.*

For a moment, he considered retreating. Calling for Drenneth's distant watchers, mounting a proper assault, approaching this with strategy instead of desperation.

But the thread to Mira pulsed weakly, and he could feel her fear along it. Distant, muted, but real. And he had less than twenty-four hours before Draven's threatened activation of the Hollow network.

*If it's a trap, it's one I have to walk into anyway.*

Cassian found the eastern loading dock entrance—exactly where Drenneth's intelligence had predicted—and slipped inside.

The interior was dark, lit only by occasional oil lamps placed at intersections. The air smelled of damp stone and rust. Cassian moved quietly through the corridors, guided by the shimmer of human presence below.

Down one level. Two. Three.

At the third level, the corridor opened into a storage chamber—and there, in a cell formed by iron bars, was Mira.

She looked up as he approached, her eyes widening. For a moment, pure relief flooded her face. Then horror.

"Cassian, run! It's a—"

"Trap?" a voice finished smoothly.

Cassian spun.

Draven Kane stood at the corridor entrance, backlit by lamplight. Cassian recognized him instantly from the aqueduct—the same handsome severity, the same impeccable bearing, the same air of absolute control. Around his neck hung the golden locket, and from it Cassian could sense the familiar presence of the Coin of Oxen, pulsing with restrained power.

"Hello again, Cassian," Draven said, his voice cultured and warm. "I knew you'd come. We have so much more to discuss than our last conversation allowed."

Behind him, figures emerged from the shadows. Not guards. Hollow. Their eyes empty, their movements synchronized. Twenty of them, blocking the only exit.

Cassian reached for his coins, but Draven raised a hand.

"Please. There's no need for violence. I have no intention of harming you." He smiled. "In fact, I've been looking forward to this conversation for quite some time. You and I, Cassian, are more alike than you realize."

"I'm nothing like you," Cassian said.

"Aren't you?" Draven walked closer, his steps measured and confident. "You use the coins to perceive value, to broker trades, to take from one and give to another. You've learned to sever the hollow from my network—a skill I didn't expect anyone to develop. The only difference between us is that I've been more ambitious. More willing to see the work through to its conclusion."

He gestured to Mira's cell. "She told you I showed her the crown, I assume? The Crown of Aram. Seven medallions, seven domains of power. I have two coins now—Oxen, which you've seen, and Waters, which I acquired last year. You have two as well—Heads and Seeds. The remaining three are scattered across the kingdoms, but I'm narrowing down their locations."

Cassian's mind raced. Two coins. Draven had bonded with two, just like him.

"How?" Cassian demanded.

"I make them submit. Oxen dominates the others. Bends them to my will."

He touched the locket gently. "When I claim all seven..." His eyes gleamed. "I'll have power beyond anything this world has seen in a thousand years."

"To do what?" Cassian demanded. "Rule? Conquer?"

"To *fix*." Draven's voice was fervent. "This world is broken, Cassian. People suffer because resources are scarce, because power is concentrated, because the Law of Balance punishes the weak and rewards the ruthless. But with all seven coins unified in the crown, I can reshape the fundamental rules of exchange. Make abundance universal. Make suffering a choice rather than an inevitability. Create a world where no one needs to trade away their humanity just to survive."

"By hollowing them first," Cassian said. "By making them empty so you can fill them with whatever you want them to be."

"By offering them a choice," Draven corrected. "Accept the trade—suffering for peace—or keep struggling. Most choose peace. And who am I to deny them?"

"They don't understand what they're giving up," Cassian said. "You manipulate them into accepting."

"I offer clarity. The Law accepts their consent. That's all that matters." Draven's smile widened. "But I didn't bring you here to debate philosophy. We both know you can't stop me through force. Your little escape at the aqueduct was impressive, but temporary. I still have my network. Still have thousands who've accepted my vision."

He paused, his expression darkening slightly. "Your father understood that, eventually. Three months ago, he discovered I was collecting the coins. He tried to convince me to stop. When I refused, he challenged me to single combat—insisted on it, actually. Very noble. Very foolish." Draven touched his locket almost fondly. "The Coin of Oxen grants me strength beyond mortal limits. Your father fought bravely, but he was no match for me."

Cassian's blood went cold. "You... you fought my father?"

"I broke him," Draven said quietly. "Shattered his ribs, ruptured internal organs. The Coin of Oxen doesn't grant finesse, but it does grant overwhelming force. I left him alive. But the injuries..." He shrugged. "He made it home. Died three days later. I heard the official story was a carriage accident."

The world seemed to narrow to a single point. Three months of questions. Three months of believing his father had died in a tragic accident. And all that time, it had been because he'd challenged Draven. Because he'd tried to stop the man standing in front of him.

"You're lying," Cassian said, but his voice shook.

"Why would I lie? Your father was a good man—intelligent, principled, willing to die for his convictions. I respected him, even as I destroyed him. He understood what I was trying to do and chose to oppose it anyway. That takes courage." Draven's expression was almost sympathetic. "I'm telling you this because I want you to understand the stakes. Your father challenged me believing conviction would overcome raw power. It didn't. He crawled home to die. You're smarter than he was. You can see this isn't a fight you can win."

Rage surged through Cassian—white-hot, blinding. Every muscle screamed at him to attack, to make Draven pay, to—

Through the thread, he felt Mira's terror spike.

Draven hadn't moved, but something had shifted in the air. Mira gasped, her hand going to her throat. When she pulled it away, her fingertips were wet with blood. A thin trickle ran from her nose.

"Stop," Draven said calmly. "Or I continue."

Cassian froze, his hand hovering over the Coin of Heads. Through their connection, he could sense what was happening—Mira's blood vessels straining, pressure building in her lungs, fluid beginning to seep where it shouldn't.

"The Coin of Waters," Draven explained, his voice conversational, "allows me to manipulate any liquid. Blood. Lymph. The fluid in your lungs." He gestured casually. "I can make someone drown on dry land. Burst their vessels from the inside. It's quite effective. And because I have my network—twenty Hollow in this building alone—I can distribute the cost of the trade across them. They bear the suffering. The Law accepts it. I remain unharmed."

Mira coughed, red flecking her lips.

"Let her go," Cassian said through gritted teeth.

"When we're finished talking, certainly."

Rage still burned in Cassian's chest, but beneath it was something colder. His father had challenged Draven, driven by conviction and righteousness. And Draven had killed him. Now Cassian stood in the same position—wanting to fight, to avenge, to strike down this man who'd caused so much suffering.

But his father had lost because he'd fought on emotion. On principle.

Cassian forced himself to breathe. To think.

"What do you want?" he asked.

Draven smiled—pleased, like a teacher whose student had finally grasped a difficult concept. "Better. Much better." He released whatever pressure he'd been applying through the Coin of Waters. Mira sagged against the cell bars, gasping.

"The connection you forged with her," Draven continued, "is remarkable. I can sense it—a thread between your minds. I lack your coin's particular gift for direct mental manipulation, but I can affect her physically." He tilted his head thoughtfully. "It's an elegant solution to a problem. You care about her. Deeply, I think. Which means you'll listen."

He began pacing, hands clasped behind his back. "Here's my offer. You have two coins. I have two. Together, we have four of the seven. We're both searching for the remaining three. We could fight—waste time, resources, lives—trying to claim them separately. Or we could cooperate. Pool our knowledge. Find the last three coins together, then decide how to use them."

"I would never help you," Cassian said.

"Not even to save her?" Draven gestured to Mira. "Not even to buy time to find another solution? I'm not asking for your loyalty, Cassian. Just a temporary truce. A business arrangement between two professionals."

"And after we find the coins?"

"Then we negotiate properly. Perhaps you'll convince me that my vision is flawed. Perhaps I'll convince you that peace is worth the price." Draven's smile widened slightly. "Or perhaps the Law will make the choice for us. But we'll have time to explore the possibilities. Time your resistance network desperately needs, given how many Hollow I control in this city alone."

Cassian looked past Draven to Mira. She was watching him intently, blood still on her lips. Her expression was complicated—fear, yes, but something else too. Determination. She gave a tiny shake of her head.

*Don't,* she mouthed silently. *Don't trust him.*

But what choice did he have?

"I need proof," Cassian said slowly. "Proof that you'll honor any agreement."

"Reasonable." Draven considered. "What would satisfy you?"

"Release her. Now. Before we negotiate anything else."

Draven laughed—genuinely amused. "And lose my leverage? No. But I'll make a counteroffer." He walked closer to Mira's cell, studying her with clinical interest. "She betrayed you once before, didn't she? Stole your coin to get her brother back."

Through the thread, Cassian felt Mira's shame flare.

"That was different," Cassian said. "You manipulated her."

"I offered her a choice. She made it." Draven turned back to Cassian. "But here's what I find interesting—you forgave her. Connected your mind to hers despite knowing she'd given you up. That suggests either remarkable compassion or remarkable stupidity. I haven't decided which."

He pulled a key from his coat pocket. "Here's my proof of good faith. I'm going to unlock her cell. Right now. She'll be free to walk out of here with you."

Cassian's breath caught. "What's the catch?"

Draven unlocked the cell door, swinging it open. Mira stared at it, not moving. "She can leave. You can both leave. Walk away from this right now, and I won't stop you."

"Then what?"

"Then tomorrow, my network activates. Every Hollow I control—hundreds of them scattered through this city—will receive a simple command. Find specific targets. People whose names I've collected from your little resistance meetings. Perin. Elena. Your friend the blacksmith." Draven's voice remained pleasant, conversational. "They'll die within hours."

Mira stood up slowly, gripping the bars for support. Her eyes were locked on Cassian.

"Or," Draven continued, "you meet me tomorrow at sunset. The old mill outside the eastern gate. Come alone. Bring both coins. We talk. And I postpone the activation order. Give you time to convince me there's a better path."

"You'll kill them anyway," Cassian said. "Once you have what you want."

"Perhaps. Or perhaps I'm sincere. Perhaps I genuinely believe cooperation is preferable to conflict." Draven stepped aside, leaving a clear path to the corridor. "You have one day to decide. Save her now and watch your friends die tomorrow. Or meet me at the mill and buy time for everyone."

He smiled. "Choose wisely. Your father chose combat and conviction. It didn't end well for him."

The words hung in the air like poison.

Cassian looked at Mira. Through their connection, he could feel her fear—but also her guilt. The memory of her betrayal. The choice she'd made to sacrifice him for Torin's sake.

She was shaking her head. *Leave me,* she mouthed. *Save the others.*

But the cell door was open. Draven had unlocked it. Was standing aside.

Cassian's mind raced. This was a choice, but not a fair one. Take Mira and condemn everyone else. Or leave her and gamble on tomorrow's meeting.

"Come," Cassian said hoarsely. "Tomorrow at sunset. I'll be there."

"Excellent." Draven's smile widened. "Come alone. Bring both coins—"

"Wait."

The voice was Mira's—rough, strained, but clear.

Cassian turned back. Mira had stepped out of the cell, past the open door. But she wasn't moving toward him. She was looking at Draven.

"You said I could leave," she said. "That we both could."

"Yes," Draven agreed, watching her with interest.

"And if we do, you activate your Hollow network. Everyone we care about dies."

"Correct."

"But if Cassian comes to the mill tomorrow, you postpone the order. Give us time."

"That was the offer, yes."

Mira took a breath, her hands shaking but her voice steady. "Then I'm staying. Not as your prisoner. As a willing... guarantee. A hostage, but one who chooses it."

Cassian's heart lurched. "Mira, no—"

She kept her eyes on Draven. "Right now, you have Cassian backed into a corner. He has to meet you tomorrow or everyone dies. But you don't trust him—you think he'll bring soldiers, or try some trick, because he's desperate." She gestured to the open cell. "If I stay voluntarily, then Cassian isn't desperate anymore. He knows I made a choice. He won't do something stupid to 'rescue' me because I'm not being held against my will."

Draven tilted his head, considering. "Go on."

"And for you, it's better than having a prisoner who's constantly looking for escape. I stay willingly, which means the Law recognizes it as a valid trade—my freedom for the postponement of your activation order. Clean. No coercion. No risk of the Law rejecting it."

Through the thread, Cassian felt the weight of what she was doing. She was turning herself into a legitimate trade instead of a hostage. Making it about the Law's acceptance rather than Draven's threats.

"Clever," Draven said slowly. "Not what I expected from someone who stole a coin to save her brother. You're learning to think strategically."

"I'm learning from my mistakes," Mira said, and her voice cracked slightly. She looked at Cassian. "I gave you up once before. Told myself I had no choice, but the truth is... I was scared. I made a selfish decision, and people died because of it. You almost died."

Tears streamed down her face. "So this is my choice now. I stay. Willingly. And you—" she pointed at Cassian, "—you go to that mill tomorrow with a clear head. Not driven by guilt or desperation or some stupid rescue fantasy. You think strategically. You be smarter than your father was. And you find a way to stop all of this."

Cassian wanted to argue, to refuse, to drag her out of there by force. But through their connection, he could feel the truth of what she was saying. This was her way of atoning. And more than that—it was strategically sound.

If Mira stayed as a prisoner, Cassian would be frantic, desperate, likely to make mistakes. But if she stayed by choice, it removed some of Draven's leverage. Made it a trade instead of a kidnapping.

"How touching," Draven said. "Though I'm not sure you've thought this through, girl. You're giving up your freedom on the gamble that Cassian will somehow outmaneuver me tomorrow. That's a losing bet."

"Maybe," Mira said. "But it's my bet to make. Do we have a trade or not? My willing cooperation—I stay here, I don't try to escape, I don't cause problems—in exchange for postponing your activation order until after tomorrow's meeting. Witnessed by the Law."

The air seemed to shift. Cassian felt the Coin of Heads respond to the proposed trade, recognizing the structure of it. An exchange offered freely, with clear terms.

Draven's smile widened. "Very well. I accept your trade. You stay willingly as my... guest. And I postpone the network activation until after sunset tomorrow. The Law witnesses this exchange."

The coins pulsed—both his and Draven's. The trade was recognized. Bound.

"No," Cassian said. "Mira, you can't—"

"I already did," she said softly. She looked at him, and through their connection he felt her resolve—absolute, unshakeable. But also her fear. Her hope that this would work. "Now go. You have one day to figure out how to save everyone. Don't waste it trying to rescue someone who chose to stay."

Draven gestured to the corridor, looking genuinely pleased. "You heard her, Cassian. The mill, tomorrow at sunset. Bring both coins. And do try to approach this meeting with an open mind. Your friend here has demonstrated admirable strategic thinking—perhaps you'll prove equally capable."

He glanced at Mira with something almost like approval. "She's right about one thing. A voluntary trade is far more stable than coercion. The Law binds it more tightly. Which means any attempt to 'rescue' her before our meeting would violate the exchange she freely made. I wouldn't recommend it."

It was a perfect trap. Mira had bound herself voluntarily, which meant extracting her would break the trade. The Law itself would resist. And if Cassian tried anyway, Draven could claim violation and activate his Hollow network immediately.

Cassian looked at Mira one last time. Through their connection, he sent: *Why? Why tie your hands like this?*

And back from her, fierce despite her fear: *Because my hands were already tied. This way, YOURS aren't. Go. Be smart. Trust me on this.*

Then Draven's presence pressed against the connection, not severing it but muting it. Cassian could still sense Mira was alive—a faint warmth somewhere behind him—but the details faded. Emotions, thoughts, location, all muted to almost nothing.

"A courtesy," Draven said. "So you won't be distracted by constant worry. You'll feel if she's in genuine danger, but otherwise... consider it my gift. So you can think clearly about tomorrow's conversation."

He smiled. "Until sunset, Cassian. I look forward to discovering whether you inherited your father's wisdom or merely his stubborn principles."

---

As Cassian climbed the stairs, each step felt heavier than the last. His father's face flashed through his mind—not as he'd been at the end, but as Cassian remembered him from childhood. Strong. Principled. Willing to fight for what was right.

And broken because of it. Dead from injuries Draven had inflicted.

*Don't fight him head-on,* Mira had sent. She was right. Draven had destroyed his father in single combat. Had two coins to Cassian's two, but years more experience. Had a network of Hollow to bear the cost of his power.

A direct fight would end the same way his father's had.

Which meant Cassian needed to be smarter. Needed to find another path.

The research. Whatever his father had sealed away in the royal archives. That was the key.

Cassian emerged into the night air—cooler now, the city settling into darkness.

He sent one last thought along the thread to Mira: *I'll find a way. I promise.*

No response. Just that faint warmth confirming her existence—Draven had muted the connection as promised.

Cassian pulled his coat tighter and headed back toward the palace.

He made it three blocks before the weight of everything crashed down on him. Cassian stumbled into an alley, pressing his back against the cold stone wall as his legs threatened to give out.

*My father. Draven broke him. Left him to crawl home and die.*

Three months. Three months of grief over what he'd been told was a tragic accident. A carriage wheel breaking at the wrong moment, a fall, injuries that couldn't be healed.

But it had been Draven. A deliberate confrontation. His father had discovered the coin collection, challenged Draven to stop, and been destroyed for it.

*And now Mira has given herself up. Made herself a willing hostage.*

The logic was sound—he could see that. By making it a trade instead of a kidnapping, she'd removed some of Draven's coercive power. Made it about the Law rather than threats. And she'd freed Cassian from the desperate need to rescue her, which would have driven him to make stupid choices.

But it still felt like abandonment. Like he'd left her in enemy hands.

The coins burned against his chest. The Coin of Heads pulsed with awareness, sensing his rage and grief. The Coin of Seeds hummed with potential, offering growth, transformation, change.

But what good were they? Draven had matched his collection and exceeded his experience. The Coin of Oxen granted inhuman strength. The Coin of Waters could kill through any liquid connection. And his network of Hollow meant he never paid the true cost of using them.

*I can't beat him,* Cassian thought. *Not in a straight fight. Not the way my father tried.*

But he couldn't walk away either. Not with Mira bound by her own choice to stay with Draven. Not with Perin, Elena, and the others marked for death if tomorrow's meeting went wrong. Not with a madman collecting the pieces of a crown that could reshape reality itself.

He took a shuddering breath, forcing himself to think. To plan.

Mira had bought him something valuable: clarity. By staying voluntarily, she'd removed the immediate crisis. Cassian didn't have to rescue her tonight. Didn't have to rush in unprepared.

He had one day. One day to learn what his father had discovered. One day to find a weakness in Draven's plan. One day to become smart enough to win a game where all the obvious moves led to defeat.

She'd trusted him with this. Trusted him to use the time wisely.

He couldn't let her down.

Cassian pushed off from the wall and continued toward the palace. His body felt heavy, exhausted from the emotional toll, but his mind was beginning to sharpen.

One day to find answers.

One day to become smarter than his father had been.

One day to find a way to win a game where all the pieces seemed stacked against him.

Cassian touched the coins through his shirt and made a silent promise—not just to Mira, but to his father's memory, to everyone Draven had broken:

*I'll stop you, Draven. I don't know how yet. But I will.*

In that last moment before Draven had dampened their connection, Cassian had felt something through the bond. Mira's memory of what Draven had shown her. The crown. The vision of a world without suffering, without scarcity.

And beneath her fear, the smallest flicker of temptation.

*That's the real trap,* Cassian realized. Not the violence or the threats. The psychological trap: making people believe that surrendering their humanity was an acceptable trade for peace.

His father had fought against that with conviction and principle. And been broken for it.

Cassian would need to be different. Smarter. More strategic.

He would need to fight not just with power, but with understanding.

And he had one day to learn how.
