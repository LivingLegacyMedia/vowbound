# Chapter 18: The Price of Rescue

Cassian ran north through the maze of alleys, his breath coming in ragged gasps. Behind him, whistles pierced the night—sharp, coordinated signals. The Society guards were organizing faster than he'd expected.

He ducked under a low archway, stumbled through a courtyard, vaulted a fence. The coins burned against his chest, their power fully restored but his body still battered. Five days of vitality spent on trades, combined with the beating from Veylin's interrogation, left him running on willpower alone.

A whistle sounded from directly ahead.

Cassian skidded to a stop, reversing direction. They were boxing him in, driving him like prey into a kill zone. He needed to think, to use the coins strategically rather than just running blind.

He pressed himself against a wall, entering the gray space. Through the coin's perception, he could sense the value patterns of the guards hunting him—their positions, their movements, the coordination of their search. At least a dozen, maybe more, spread across six blocks.

But he also sensed something else. To the west, toward the docks where Torin had fled—concentrated activity. Many guards converging. Had they caught him?

To the east, where Perin had gone—pursuit, but scattered. The guards there were searching but hadn't found their target yet.

And to the south, in the merchant quarter where Mira had disappeared—

Cassian's breath caught.

Too many guards. Far too many. And they weren't searching—they were stationary. Surrounding something. Or someone.

*Mira.*

He wanted to go to her, to help, but three guards rounded the corner directly in front of him. No time for subtlety.

Cassian pulled from the value of their alertness, draining just enough to make them sluggish. It cost him another day—six total now—but they stumbled, confused, as he sprinted past them.

He had to get to higher ground. Had to see what was happening.

A bell tower rose two blocks ahead—part of a small chapel. Cassian ran for it, pushed through the unlocked door, and climbed the narrow stairs. His legs screamed in protest. His vision blurred. But he kept climbing.

At the top, he emerged onto the bell platform and looked out over the city.

There—in the merchant quarter—torchlight. Dozens of torches, surrounding a narrow alley. He could see guards forming a perimeter, hear shouting even from this distance.

And then, cutting through the chaos like a blade, a new sound.

Horns. Royal horns.

From the north, a squadron of mounted soldiers appeared, wearing the King's colors. They rode hard through the streets, scattering civilians, heading straight for the merchant quarter.

*Aldric sent them,* Cassian realized. *He's intervening.*

Relief and dread warred in his chest. Relief that help had come. Dread at what it would cost the King politically.

The royal soldiers reached the merchant quarter and immediately engaged. Cassian could hear the captain's voice carrying across the distance: "By order of King Aldric, all personnel of the Merchant's Relief Society are under arrest!"

The Society guards hesitated, then some began to surrender. Others tried to run and were quickly overtaken by mounted soldiers. Within minutes, the situation was secured.

But was Mira there? Had they found her in time?

Cassian descended the bell tower stairs as fast as his battered body allowed. He needed to get to the merchant quarter, needed to see—

A hand grabbed his shoulder as he exited the chapel.

Cassian spun, coins raised defensively, but it was Torin—soaking wet, smelling of river water, his expression as flat as ever.

"Jumped," Torin said simply. "Docks. Water. Guards don't swim well."

Despite everything, Cassian almost laughed. "You're alive."

"For now." Torin's eyes focused on the distant torchlight. "Royal guards?"

"The King sent them. They're arresting the Society personnel."

"Mira?"

"I don't know." Cassian started moving toward the merchant quarter. "But I'm going to find out."

They ran together through the emptying streets. Citizens were retreating indoors, shuttering windows, trying to avoid whatever conflict was unfolding. Smart.

As they approached the merchant quarter, a royal guard stepped out to block their path—then recognized Cassian and immediately straightened.

"Master Cassian. Captain Drenneth is looking for you."

"Where is he?"

"Three blocks south. But sir, you should—"

Cassian was already moving.

He found Captain Drenneth in a narrow alley, supervising the binding of captured guards. The captain was in his fifties, grizzled and competent, wearing full armor despite the late hour.

"Master Cassian," Drenneth said, turning. "The King sent us to extract you and your companions. Are you injured?"

"I'm alive." Cassian scanned the alley desperately. "The others—Mira, Perin—did you find them?"

"We have search teams sweeping the district." Drenneth gestured to his soldiers. "Found one of your group already—the carpenter, Perin. He was cornered two streets over. We're bringing him here now."

"And Mira? The woman?"

Drenneth's expression tightened. "No sign yet. But we're still searching."

"She came this way. South, into the merchant quarter. I saw guards surrounding this area before you arrived."

"We found guards here, yes. But no prisoners when we secured the scene." Drenneth turned to one of his men. "Bring me that Society administrator. The one who tried to run."

A soldier dragged forward a man in gray robes—one of the handlers from the facility. His nose was broken, blood streaming down his face.

"Where's the woman?" Drenneth demanded. "The one your guards were pursuing in this district?"

The handler spat blood. "I don't know what you're talking about."

Cassian stepped forward, entering the gray space. He could see the lie written in the man's value patterns—the fear, the knowledge he was hiding.

"You're lying," Cassian said quietly. "And I can prove it."

He pulled gently from the value of the man's confidence, just enough to crack his resolve. The handler's eyes widened as he felt something shift inside him.

"Where is she?" Cassian repeated.

"I—" The handler's voice shook. "Administrator Veylin took her. Priority extraction protocol. Orders from the council."

Ice formed in Cassian's chest. "When?"

"Right after you escaped. Veylin got a message—said certain high-value prisoners were to be moved immediately if rescue was imminent." The handler was talking faster now, desperate to cooperate. "She took the woman and left through the back exit. I don't know where they went. I swear I don't know."

Cassian released him, and the man slumped in the soldier's grip.

"High-value prisoner," Drenneth said grimly. "Meaning she's worth more than just information."

"She can access the coins' power," Cassian said, his fragmented thoughts racing. "I showed her how, let her train with them. Draven wants to study it. Or use it. Or—"

He didn't finish. The implications were too terrible.

Torin spoke from behind him, voice flat: "Leverage. She's leverage against you."

"And bait," Cassian agreed. "He knows I'll come for her."

Drenneth's jaw tightened. "Master Cassian, my orders are to secure you and bring you to the palace. The King was explicit about that."

"I'm not leaving without her."

"You don't have a choice." Drenneth gestured, and two soldiers moved to flank Cassian—respectfully, but ready to enforce compliance if necessary. "The King risked significant political capital deploying us tonight. The least you can do is report to him before running headlong into another trap."

Cassian wanted to argue. Every instinct screamed at him to search, to chase, to find Mira before it was too late.

But Drenneth was right. He was exhausted, battered, operating at a fraction of his capacity. Rushing after Mira in his current state would help no one.

"The old mill," Cassian said quietly. "Outside the eastern gate. We were supposed to regroup there tomorrow night, two hours after sunset. If she escaped Veylin somehow, she'll go there."

"Then we'll have guards watching it," Drenneth promised. "If she shows, we'll secure her immediately." He softened slightly. "But Master Cassian, you need to accept the possibility that she's already in Draven's hands. And if that's true, going after her plays directly into his plans."

"I know." Cassian clutched the coins tighter. "But I'm going anyway."

"Not tonight, you're not." Drenneth gestured to a waiting wagon. "Tonight, you're coming to the palace. You're going to eat, rest, and report to the King. In that order. Then, if you still want to chase after her tomorrow, at least you'll have a chance of surviving."

Perin emerged from a side street, escorted by two royal guards. His face lit up with relief when he saw Cassian.

"You made it," Perin said. "I thought—when the guards cornered me, I thought we'd all been caught."

"The King sent help," Cassian said. "But Mira—"

"I know. I heard." Perin's expression darkened. "So what do we do?"

"First, you find Elena," Cassian said firmly. "Get her somewhere safe. That's your only priority."

"And then?"

"Then we figure out how to get Mira back."

Drenneth interrupted. "Into the wagon, both of you. We need to clear this area before more Society personnel arrive or the merchant's guild starts asking questions."

Cassian let himself be guided to the wagon. Torin climbed in silently beside him. Perin followed, moving like a man in a daze.

As the wagon pulled away from the merchant quarter, Cassian looked back at the scattered torchlight, the arrested guards, the chaos of the incomplete rescue.

They'd escaped. The King had intervened. But Mira was gone.

And somewhere in the distance, she was being delivered to Draven Kane.

---

The chamber was deep underground—Mira could tell by the chill in the air, the absolute silence, the sense of weight pressing down from above. The walls were carved from bedrock, lit by oil lamps that cast dancing shadows across ancient stone.

Administrator Veylin shoved her through the heavy iron door.

"Move," Veylin ordered, her voice cold and precise.

Mira stumbled forward, wrists bound behind her back. Her eye was still swollen from the earlier interrogation, her ribs aching from where a guard had struck her during the pursuit. She'd fought—taken down three of them before they'd overwhelmed her—but there had been too many.

And then Veylin had appeared with a message and that terrible, satisfied smile.

"Priority extraction," she'd said. "The council wants you delivered personally."

The chamber was circular, maybe twenty feet across. No windows. A single door—the one she'd just been pushed through. And in the center, sitting in a high-backed chair like it was a throne, was the man she'd met once before.

Draven Kane.

He looked a bit different from what she remembered, with dark hair silvering at the temples. Handsome in a severe way, like a scholar or a successful merchant. He wore fine clothes, well-tailored but not ostentatious. In the tent, he'd seemed almost ordinary, blending in with the handlers. Here, in this underground chamber, everything about him suggested power, refinement, control.

But his eyes were cold. Pale gray, calculating, weighing her like a merchant appraising goods.

And beneath his shirt, Mira could sense something. A presence. Power thrumming with a familiar rhythm.

Another coin.

"Mira," Draven said, his voice smooth and cultured. "Thank you for joining us. Please, sit."

He gestured to a chair facing his own. When Mira didn't move, Veylin shoved her toward it. Mira sat, more from exhaustion than compliance.

"The others?" Draven asked Veylin without looking away from Mira.

"Escaped. The King's guard arrived too quickly—we lost the facility and approximately thirty personnel to arrests." Veylin's jaw was tight with barely contained anger. "But we executed the extraction protocol as planned. This one was separated and secured before the royal forces could locate her."

"And Cassian has the coins back?"

"Yes. Both of them."

Draven smiled, and it was genuinely pleased. "Perfect. Let him keep them for now. He can't use them against us if he doesn't know where to find us. And when he does come—and he will—he'll bring them right to me. Willingly."

Veylin's expression tightened. "You're certain he'll come for her?"

"She's his ally. His companion. He risked everything to save her brother—of course he'll come for her." Draven stood, walking slowly around Mira's chair. "We tried force. It didn't work—he escaped with both coins. Now we try leverage. Make him desperate enough, emotional enough, and he'll trade anything. Even the coins."

Mira glared at him despite her exhaustion. "If this was your plan, it's a terrible one. Cassian will come for me."

"I'm counting on it." Draven leaned forward, studying her with the detached interest of a scholar examining a rare specimen. "Tell me, Mira. When Cassian saved your brother—partially, imperfectly—did you feel gratitude? Or guilt?"

Mira's stomach twisted, but she kept her voice level. "Go to hell."

"Guilt, I think," Draven continued as if she hadn't spoken. "Because Torin isn't really saved, is he? He's functional but damaged. A shadow of who he was. The brilliant mind reduced to mechanical cataloging. The warmth replaced by flat observation." His voice was almost gentle. "And you know Cassian could fix him. Fully restore him. But he hasn't. Have you ever wondered why?"

"Because it would cost too much," Mira said through gritted teeth. "The same reason you won't restore anyone. It's not worth it to you."

"Ah, but that's where you're wrong." Draven stood, walking slowly around her chair. "I don't restore people because I have a different vision. A better one. Universal order. True peace. A world where no one needs to become Hollow because I'll have the power to simply provide for everyone. But Cassian?" He paused behind her, his voice close to her ear. "He simply hasn't figured out how to restore the Hollow completely yet. Or more accurately, he hasn't been willing to pay the true price."

Mira's heart was pounding. She could feel the presence of Draven's coin now, so close. The power radiating from it made her skin crawl.

"What are you talking about?" she asked.

"The Coin of Seeds doesn't just grow plants, Mira. It grows anything. Life. Consciousness. Lost memories. The very essence of a person." Draven moved back into view, sitting on the edge of the table across from her. "With enough understanding, enough power, enough willingness to experiment, it could regrow your brother's missing pieces. Make him whole again. Restore not just his function but his soul."

Mira's breath caught. "You're lying."

"Am I? Ask yourself—why did the Coin of Seeds respond when Cassian tried to restore the Hollow? Why did it work at all, even partially?" Draven's pale eyes held hers. "Because the coin understands restoration. Growth. Renewal. It can accelerate the growth of anything that can grow—including the damaged pathways in a human mind. Cassian just doesn't fully understand its potential yet. Or perhaps he does, and he's afraid of what it would cost him."

"Even if that's true," Mira said, "he'd never help you."

"Help me? No, probably not." Draven smiled. "But I could help you. I know the secrets of the Coin of Seeds—secrets Cassian hasn't discovered yet. Or perhaps he has, and he's simply unwilling to pay the price." He leaned forward. "Bring me the coins, Mira. When Cassian comes for you—and he will—convince him to trade them for your freedom. Both coins, willingly surrendered. And in exchange, I'll restore your brother completely. Make him whole. Return everything he lost."

"You want me to betray him," Mira said flatly.

"I want you to save your brother." Draven's voice was reasonable, patient. "Cassian has had the Coin of Seeds for how long? And Torin is still broken. Do you really think he's going to restore him fully? Or will he keep your brother in this half-alive state forever, just functional enough to be useful?"

Mira's stomach twisted. She wanted to argue, but the doubt was already there.

"What do you really want with the coins?" she asked. "Why do you need them?"

"Information. Power." Draven's smile widened. "You see, Mira, I'm collecting them. Cassian has two now—the Coin of Heads and the Coin of Seeds. I have my own coin." He placed a hand gently over the locket hanging from his neck. "But there are seven total, seven gems, scattered across the kingdoms."

He stood, walking to a shelf where something rested beneath a black cloth. He pulled the cloth away, revealing an object that made Mira's breath catch.

A crown. Ancient, tarnished silver, with seven empty settings arranged around its band. Even damaged and incomplete, it radiated power.

"The Crown of Aram," Draven said reverently. "Kings and conquerors have searched for it for centuries. I found it three years ago, buried in ruins older than the current kingdoms. And I've been collecting its fragments ever since."

He turned back to her. "When I reunite all seven coins with the crown and place it on my head, I'll command all the forces of nature. I'll have the power to reshape this broken world. To create true order. True peace. A world where no one starves, no one suffers, no one needs to trade away their humanity just to survive."

"You're insane," Mira breathed.

"Visionary," Draven corrected. "The difference is success. And I will succeed, Mira. With or without your cooperation. But with you? It becomes simple. Cassian trades the coins for your life. I get what I need. You get your brother back, whole and healthy. Everyone wins."

"Except the world," Mira said. "If you get all seven coins and the crown—"

"The world gets peace. Order. An end to suffering." Draven's voice was fervent. "Do you know how many people become Hollow every year? How many starve? How many die in wars over resources I could simply provide? The current system is broken, Mira. I'm offering to fix it."

Mira wanted to spit in his face. Wanted to refuse categorically.

But the image rose unbidden in her mind—Torin, whole and healthy. Smiling. Laughing. The brilliant, warm brother she'd lost, restored completely. Not damaged. Not mechanical. Truly saved.

"I need to think about it," she said quietly.

"Of course. You have time." Draven nodded to Veylin. "Make sure our guest is comfortable. Food, water, a proper bed. This doesn't have to be unpleasant."

Veylin grabbed Mira's arm and pulled her toward a side door. As Mira was led away, Draven's voice followed her.

"Oh, and Mira? When Cassian comes for you—and he will—remember this: He's had the power to restore your brother for weeks. He's chosen not to. Ask yourself why that is."

The door closed behind her, and Mira was pushed into a small but comfortable room. A bed. A washbasin. A window—barred, but at least there was light.

Veylin cut the ropes binding her wrists. "Don't try anything stupid. There are guards outside, and this room is three levels underground. You're not escaping."

Then she left, and Mira was alone.

She sat on the bed, trembling. Not from fear. From the terrible, creeping doubt.

Could she really save Torin? Was Draven telling the truth?

And more importantly—had Cassian known this was possible and simply not told her?

Mira touched her wrist where she could still feel the faint echo of the coins' presence. Power, distant but present. Connected to Cassian somehow, to the coins, to possibilities she'd never imagined.

She closed her eyes and saw two futures branching before her.

In one, Torin remained broken—functional but hollow, cataloging facts without understanding them, never again feeling joy or curiosity or love. Never holding Elena and knowing why it mattered.

In the other, he smiled. He laughed at her jokes. He understood that he loved his daughter, and felt it, truly felt it.

The price was betrayal. But wasn't love supposed to justify anything?

She didn't know anymore.

Mira pulled the thin blanket over herself and tried to sleep. But her dreams, when they came, were filled with Torin's lost smile and Draven's reasonable voice, offering her the one thing she wanted most.

---

Cassian woke to sunlight streaming through the window and someone knocking on his door.

"Master Cassian?" A servant's voice. "The King requests your presence for breakfast."

Cassian sat up, every muscle protesting. The coins were still tucked safely in his shirt. Six days gone, but at least he was alive.

He washed quickly, changed into fresh clothes the palace had provided, and went downstairs to the King's private dining room.

King Aldric was already there, along with Captain Drenneth. They both looked exhausted.

"How did you find us?" Cassian asked as he sat. "How did you know where to send the guards?"

Drenneth answered. "Perin's daughter. Elena. She made it to the palace gates around dusk, demanding to see the King. Took three guards to calm her down enough to make sense of what she was saying."

"Elena?" Cassian's chest tightened. "Is she—"

"Safe. Reunited with her father in the east wing," Drenneth said. "She saw which direction the Society guards took you after the capture. Followed at a distance, saw them take you into the Relief Society facility. Then she ran here as fast as her legs could carry her."

The King shook his head with something like admiration. "Brave girl. Terrified, but she wouldn't leave until we promised to send help."

Cassian felt a weight lift slightly. Elena was safe. Perin had his daughter back. Small victories.

"What about Mira?" Cassian asked. "Any word?"

"Nothing," Drenneth said grimly. "The trail is cold. Whoever extracted her knew what they were doing."

"I'm going after her," Cassian said.

The King and Drenneth exchanged a glance.

"We need intelligence first," Aldric said carefully. "Information about where she's being held, how many guards—"

"I don't have time for that." Cassian stood abruptly. "Every hour I wait, Draven has more time to break her."

"Which is exactly what he wants," the King said. "He's baiting you, Cassian. Make you desperate enough and you'll walk into whatever trap he's prepared."

"I know." Cassian met his eyes. "But there has to be a way to save her without risking everything else."

"Not without a plan, there's not." The King's voice hardened. "I didn't risk my political standing rescuing you just to watch you throw your life away on an emotional impulse. You don't know where she is. You don't know what defenses he has. You're exhausted, battered, and operating on feeling instead of strategy."

Cassian took a breath, forcing himself to think past the panic. "You're right. I need intelligence first. And I need to recover enough to actually use the coins effectively." His jaw tightened. "But I also need to move faster than Drenneth's network can gather information. Draven knows we'll be cautious—he's counting on it. Every day we wait is another day he has to break her or turn her."

"Then what do you suggest?"

Cassian closed his eyes, deep in thought. "I don't know yet. All I know is, my coins are not the same as his. They have abilities he doesn't have. So the way for me to outsmart him is to rely on their unique power. I'll spend time with them tonight. Find some way to track where they took her."

The King nodded slowly. "There's wisdom in that. Use your unique advantages instead of fighting Draven's fight." He stood. "Get some sleep. Tomorrow, we'll see what your coin can show us."

"One day," Cassian said, his voice tight. "I'll give you one day to find something. After that, I'm going. With or without your help."

The King held his gaze for a moment, then nodded slowly. "Fair enough. One day."

Cassian turned and left the dining room, his frustration simmering. His body ached, his head pounded, but his mind was already racing.

He made his way back to his guest quarters and locked the door.

*Think,* he told himself. *There has to be a way to find her. To reach her.*

He couldn't just wait for intelligence. Couldn't sit idle while Mira faced Draven's manipulations. The man was too clever, too patient. He'd break her or turn her, and Cassian would lose her either way.

But how could he find her when he didn't even know where she was?

Cassian entered the gray space, desperate for any insight. Value threads blazed around him—the expensive furnishings in the room, the coins in his hands, the distant pulse of life throughout the palace.

And then, faintly, something else.

A thread. Thin, barely perceptible, stretching away from the coin and into the distance. Not like the bond to the coins themselves—that was bright, strong, constant. This was different. Fragile. So faint he'd never noticed it before. Like a spider's silk connecting to...

*To what?*

Cassian focused on the thread, following it with his perception. It extended north. Down through the city. Beyond the walls. Into—

The thread faded, too distant to track clearly.

But it was there. Something connected to the Coin of Heads. Something—or someone—far away.

Cassian's eyes snapped open. He sat up, staring at the coin in his hand.

*Mira.*

He'd taught her to access the coins' power. Showed her how to perceive value, enter the gray space. And in doing so, he'd created a connection—her mind learning to resonate with the same power he wielded.

What if that connection was more than just shared knowledge? What if it was a bridge?

The Coin of Heads governed wisdom. Perception. Understanding. He'd been using it to perceive value—to see the worth in objects, to understand the patterns of exchange. But the coin's domain was larger than that. It governed *heads*. The seat of thought. Consciousness. Minds themselves.

What if perception didn't just mean seeing value in things, but understanding *minds*?

His heart pounded. He'd never tried anything like this. Didn't even know if it was possible.

But he had to try.

Cassian held the Coin of Heads in both palms and closed his eyes. He entered the gray space fully, letting his perception expand as far as it would go.

But this time, instead of looking for connection. For the thread that linked him to someone else who knew the coin's touch.

*Mira,* he thought, pushing his awareness along that fragile thread. *Can you hear me?*

Nothing.

The thread wavered, barely there. The distance was too great, his understanding too incomplete.

Cassian pushed harder, trying to force the connection, but it slipped away like water through his fingers.

*This isn't about force,* he realized. *The coin governs wisdom, understanding. Not coercion.*

He relaxed his grip, let his desperate need fade into calm focus. The Coin of Heads wasn't a weapon to force his will on others. It was a tool for perceiving truth, for understanding what already existed.

The thread was already there. The connection already made. He just needed to see it clearly.

Cassian took a slow breath and tried again. Not pushing. Not demanding. Simply... opening himself to what the coin could show him.

*Mira. If you're there, if you can sense this, I'm reaching out. Just try to reach between minds that share the same power.*

For a long moment, nothing.

Then—faint, like an echo across vast distance:

*...Cassian?*
