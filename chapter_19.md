# Chapter 19: What Can Be Freely Given

*Three hours earlier—while Cassian walked toward the aqueduct*

Torin descended into the Royal Library's restricted archives with the focused precision of someone who no longer required sleep.

The head archivist—Veldris, skeletal and ancient—gave him the key after reading King Aldric's authorization. "Third level. His Majesty's father sealed these chambers two years before he died. You're the first person granted access since."

Torin moved through narrow stone passages, lamp in hand. He'd been awake for thirty-six hours. The partial restoration Cassian had given him made that possible—his mind clearer, more focused than it had been in years.

The third level chamber was cramped, dominated by a map covered in pins and threads. Research documents lay stacked on every surface—organized, methodical, obsessive.

Torin set the lamp down and began processing information.

**Hour One: Network Structure**

Field reports from someone named Seris—Guild researcher. Analysis of Draven's recruitment patterns. The network didn't spread randomly. It grew through specific nodes.

*Emissaries.*

Torin's analytical mind locked onto the pattern immediately. Individual Hollow weren't all connected directly to Draven. They connected through intermediaries. Conduits. Cut an Emissary, and everyone tethered through them would disconnect simultaneously.

Elegant system. But vulnerable.

**Hour Two: Failed Operations**

He found letters in handwriting he vaguely recognized. Rowan. Cassian's father.

*"Your Majesty,*

*The network grows through specific individuals—Emissaries who serve as anchor points. I've identified at least eight in the capital region. If we could sever them simultaneously, we might fragment Kane's entire operation.*

*I'm developing severance techniques. But I'll need authorization to act before he consolidates further.*

*Rowan"*

Dated a year ago.

A second document detailed an operation three months later—unauthorized. Rowan had severed two Emissaries. Disconnected approximately 600 Hollow. Results: catastrophic. The disconnected had no framework for recovery. Many died. Others begged to reconnect. Within days, Draven had repaired the network.

*Severance without restoration creates more suffering than it prevents.*

Torin processed this clinically. Rowan had the technique but lacked restoration capability. Cassian had both coins now. But did he have enough seed material to restore hundreds?

**Hour Three: The King's Death**

Hidden in a sealed drawer—a note dated three months ago:

*"Challenged Kane to single combat. The Coin of Oxen made him unstoppable. He broke me deliberately, left me to die slowly.*

*But I learned his weakness: Kane has no true allies. His power comes from taking, never receiving. He's forgotten what it means to be freely given anything.*

*Tell Aldric: Build what Kane can't. That's how you win."*

Cassian's father. Killed by Draven three months ago. The "carriage accident" had been a lie.

Torin sat back, constructing his analysis.

*Premise 1: Network operates through Emissaries.*
*Premise 2: Severing creates mass disconnection.*
*Premise 3: Disconnection without restoration fails.*
*Premise 4: Cassian has restoration capability Rowan lacked.*
*Premise 5: But individual seed material won't scale to hundreds.*

*Conclusion: Success requires distributed contribution.*

Who would give freely? Who would volunteer pieces of themselves?

Torin thought of Perin, the freed emissary. The refugees. Cassian himself, who helped without transactional motive.

*Illogical by pure efficiency metrics. But effective.*

Maybe that was the point.

**Hour Four: Veylin Marr**

Intelligence reports on current Emissaries. Fourteen total. Veylin Marr commanded the largest network: 600-800 Hollow. Based in the eastern district.

The woman who'd recruited him. Who'd given him Draven's locket to offer Mira.

Torin felt something flicker in the void—not quite emotion, but recognition. If they severed Veylin, they'd fragment Draven's largest power base.

And free the network that had consumed him.

He made detailed notes. Warehouse layout. Guard patterns. Entry points. By dawn, he had a complete operational plan.

---

Cassian returned just before sunrise, exhausted from the aqueduct confrontation. Torin intercepted him in the eastern wing.

"I found the network architecture," Torin said without preamble. "Your father discovered it years ago. Attempted severance but failed—no restoration capability. You have both tools now."

He handed Cassian his notes.

"You researched all night?" Cassian asked.

"Thirty-six hours. Don't require sleep anymore." Torin tapped the documents. "Emissary system. Hierarchical structure. Sever an Emissary, disconnect everyone tethered through them. Your father tried. It failed because the disconnected had nowhere to go."

"How many per Emissary?"

"Veylin Marr commands 600-800."

Cassian's expression darkened. "Veylin. She took Mira."

"If we disconnect her, we fragment his largest network."

"We?"

"I can perform the severance. You taught me the technique when you freed me. While you meet Draven tomorrow, I lead a team to her warehouse. Sever the connection. You provide restoration energy."

"That's what my father tried. It failed."

"You have something he didn't." Torin paused. "The coin of seeds. But there's no way you can pay the price of restoring 800 souls. Not alone."

"Then what—"

"Distributed contribution. Multiple volunteers offering fragments. Building what Draven can't—a network based on choice."

Cassian studied the documents, silent for a long moment.

"Your father wrote that," Torin added. "His final instruction before Draven killed him three months ago."

---

King Aldric arranged a small meeting that morning. Perin arrived with Elena. Three refugees. Captain Drenneth. The King himself.

Torin presented his findings with mechanical precision. The Emissary structure. Veylin's network. The operational plan.

"The critical gap is restoration material," Torin explained. "800 people require seed fragments. Cassian can provide some, but not enough alone."

"I'll contribute what I can," Perin said immediately. "Not much—I'm still rebuilding. But if small pieces help..."

"I can give some," one refugee said. "After what they did to us... if it helps someone fight back..."

Another nodded. "Whatever it takes to undo what was done."

One by one, they offered fragments.

"This is it," the King said quietly. "What my father meant. Draven built his empire on taking. We're building ours on giving."

But Cassian looked troubled. "It's not enough. Even with everyone contributing, we don't have material for hundreds. And memory trades are too nuanced—I can't broker them in bulk. It's not scalable."

Silence.

Then Torin spoke: "The Coin of Seeds doesn't just broker memories. It channels growth energy. Vitality. Life force."

"Yes, but—"

"What if people offered that instead? Not complex memories requiring individual negotiation. Simple vitality. Energy they could give consciously, channeled through you to the disconnected."

Cassian's eyes widened. "Use the Coin of Seeds to create a network. People offering energy willingly, flowing through me to those who need restoration."

"A voluntary network," the King said. "The opposite of what Draven built."

"But who would agree to that?" Perin asked. "Giving away their energy to a stranger? That's exhausting. Dangerous even."

"People who believe in what you're fighting for," the King said. "People who see you standing against Draven and choose to support you."

"You're talking about the whole town," Cassian said. "Most of them don't even know me. Why would they—"

"Make the offer," Torin interrupted. "Present it as a choice. 'Your energy, to me. In exchange, I fight for you.' Let them decide."

"And if they refuse?"

"Then we proceed with what we have." Torin's expression didn't change. "But if they accept... you'd have power Draven can't match. He draws from enslaved victims. You'd draw from willing supporters."

Cassian thought of Draven's network—thousands of Hollow feeding him power involuntarily. Versus what Torin proposed: people consciously choosing to lend strength.

The Law would recognize both. But one was theft, the other a gift.

"I'll make the offer," Cassian said slowly. "Before I meet Draven. Give people the choice. If enough accept..."

"You'll be fast enough, strong enough to match his Coin of Oxen," Torin finished.

"Wait," Captain Drenneth said. "You're planning to fight Draven? Physically?"

"Why not?" Cassian met his eyes. "He'll expect me to try negotiation, manipulation, clever tactics. He won't expect a direct challenge. And if I can draw on willing support while he's distracted fighting me..."

"Torin and I sever the Emissaries," Perin said, understanding. "Drain his network while he's occupied."

"Exactly."

"That's insane," Drenneth muttered. But he was smiling. "Completely insane. Challenge a man with superhuman strength to single combat while your friends sabotage his power source."

"My father tried wisdom," Cassian said. "The King's father tried strength. Both failed because they fought alone. Maybe what works is fighting together—with people who choose to stand with you."

The King nodded slowly. "My father's last words: 'Build what Kane can't.' This is it, isn't it? A network based on trust instead of theft."

"If enough people accept the offer," Cassian said.

"They will," Perin said quietly. "People want to believe generosity can stand against cruelty. Give them the chance to prove it."

---

They spent the day preparing. Torin mapped Veylin's warehouse. Drenneth positioned soldiers. Cassian practiced channeling energy through the Coin of Seeds—taking Perin's offered vitality and redirecting it, learning to be a conduit rather than just a source.

It was exhausting. Even small amounts of transferred energy left him drained. If he tried to channel hundreds of people simultaneously...

"You'll burn out," Torin observed. "The volume will overwhelm you."

"Then I'll burn out fighting," Cassian said. "Better than watching Draven win."

As evening approached, the King made an announcement. A town gathering at the old mill. Tomorrow at sunset. The King's ledger-keeper would speak about the Hollow threat.

"Will they come?" Cassian asked.

"They'll come," the King said. "Whether they listen is another question."

---

That night, Cassian couldn't sleep. He stood in the palace courtyard under stars, both coins burning in his palms.

Tomorrow he'd walk to the mill. Make an offer to a town that barely knew him. Ask them to give freely of their strength to power a fight against an enemy most didn't believe existed.

And if they refused, he'd face Draven alone.

He felt the thread to Mira pulse weakly—still dampened, but present.

*I'm trying to be smarter than my father,* he sent along the connection. *Trying to build what Draven can't. I don't know if it'll work.*

No response. Just that faint warmth.

Cassian closed his eyes, thinking through the plan one more time.

Torin and Perin would target Veylin and at least two other major Emissaries. Sever them simultaneously. Disconnect perhaps 2,000 Hollow total. While Draven reeled from that disruption, Cassian would challenge him to single combat—binding the confrontation by the Law so Draven couldn't simply walk away.

If enough townspeople accepted the energy-offering trade, Cassian would have the strength to match Draven's Coin of Oxen. If they didn't... well, he'd try anyway.

It was desperate. Fragile. Built on hope that people would choose to help.

But it was also the only plan that felt right.

"Some things are worth pursuing even if the world calls you a fool for it."

His father's words. Rowan had died believing them eight years ago—or three months ago, Cassian still wasn't sure which timeline was accurate. The King's father had died believing them three months ago.

Tomorrow, Cassian would find out if they were right.

---

Dawn came cold and bright. Cassian dressed simply—worker's clothes, not finery. If he was asking the town to trust him, he needed to look like one of them.

Perin arrived early with Elena. "She wanted to see you before..." He didn't finish.

Elena looked up at Cassian with solemn eyes. "Papa says you're going to fight the bad man."

"I'm going to try."

"Will you win?"

"I don't know."

She thought about that, then nodded. "Papa says sometimes trying is more important than winning. Because if you don't try, you already lost."

Cassian knelt down to her level. "Your papa is very wise."

"I know." She threw her arms around his neck, hugging him fiercely. "Be careful. And come back. Papa needs you to finish fixing him."

Cassian's throat tightened. "I will."

---

By sunset, the team was assembled. Torin, Perin, three refugees, Drenneth's soldiers. Each one prepared for their role.

"Veylin's warehouse has three entry points," Torin reviewed one final time. "We split into three teams. Simultaneous breach. I locate Veylin, sever her connection. Perin, you handle the secondary Emissaries—I've marked their probable locations."

"What if Draven detects the disruption?" one refugee asked.

"He will," Cassian said. "But he'll be occupied. I'm going to challenge him to single combat. Bind it by the Law. He won't be able to respond to the network disruption without breaking the terms."

"And if you can't match his strength?"

"Then I die. But at least you'll have time to free as many as possible."

Silence.

"That's not going to happen," Perin said fiercely. "The town will accept your offer. They'll give you the strength you need."

"You don't know that."

"I know people want to believe generosity matters. Give them the chance."

The King approached with the bronze medallion. "My father wanted you to carry this. Proof of royal authorization. And a reminder of what you're fighting for."

Cassian took it, feeling its weight.

"Whatever happens," the King said quietly, "you've already proven that Draven is wrong. You've already shown that people can choose to help each other. That's worth everything."

---

The King had called for something unprecedented: a public assembly. Not in the square, but on the plains outside the city walls where thousands could gather. Where everyone could witness what came next.

By sunset, the entire capital had turned out. Thousands of people—merchants, laborers, refugees, nobles, beggars, soldiers. They lined the city walls, filled the plains, created a sea of faces stretching to the horizon.

And at the center, visible to all, stood the old mill.

Cassian stood before the crowd, the King at his side.

"My name is Cassian," he said, his voice repeated and amplified by one of the King's advisors. "Tomorrow at sunset, I will confront Draven Kane at that mill. If I subdue him, he will release those he's enslaved and surrender his authority over the Hollow network. If he subdues me, I surrender my coins and swear to serve his vision."

Murmurs rippled through the crowd.

"I can't defeat him alone," Cassian continued. "Draven has superhuman strength. He draws power from thousands of Hollow in his network, people he's enslaved through deception and desperation. Against that, I'm just a ledger-keeper with old relics and no army."

"Then why fight?" someone shouted.

"Because someone has to." Cassian's voice was steady. "Because if we don't stand against him now, he'll consume this entire kingdom. Because..." He paused, choosing his words carefully. "Because I believe there's another way to build power. Not through theft and coercion, but through willing cooperation."

He looked across the sea of faces.

"I'm making an offer to all of you. Your strength, your vitality, given to me temporarily during the fight. In exchange, I commit to defending this city with everything I have. To fighting for your freedom, not my own power. The Law will recognize it as a fair trade—your energy for my service."

Silence. Thousands of people, all processing what he'd asked.

"This only works if you give freely," Cassian said. "No coercion. No pressure. You can refuse, and I'll fight anyway with what little strength I have. Or you can accept, and together we'll show Draven that cooperation can match stolen power."

More silence. Then voices from the crowd:

"How do we know you won't just take our energy and run?"

"Why should we trust some ledger-keeper over the Supreme Voice?"

"Draven promised my brother peace. What are you promising?"

Cassian felt the doubt like a physical weight. These people didn't know him. Didn't have reason to believe. And he was asking them to give something precious—their own vitality—for a fight they didn't think he could win.

Widow Marta stepped forward from the crowd. "I know him," she called out, her voice firm. "He corrected the tax records when it cost him his job. Helped my district when no one else would. He's proven he cares about more than himself."

"That's one person's word," someone else shouted. "Not enough!"

Cassian felt his heart sink. He'd hoped for immediate support. For people to step forward eagerly like in his imagination. But this was reality—thousands of strangers being asked to trust someone they barely knew against an enemy they feared.

Perin stepped forward. "I'll accept. My strength to you, Cassian. For Elena's future."

Cassian felt the connection form through the Coin of Seeds. One person. Just one.

Then Torin: "Mine as well. For what you did for me, damaged as it was."

Two people.

Then one of the refugees Cassian had helped restore: "You gave me pieces of yourself. I give mine freely in return."

Three.

Four.

Five.

Twenty.

Forty.

The ones he'd helped directly—the refugees, the tax-burdened citizens of Southgate, a few merchants who'd witnessed his integrity. They stepped forward one by one, accepting the trade.

But the vast majority of the crowd stood back. Skeptical. Afraid. Unwilling to commit.

By the time the offers stopped, Cassian had maybe eighty connections. Out of thousands.

It wasn't enough. Not remotely enough to match Draven's network of thousands.

"That's your army?" someone in the crowd mocked. "Eighty people? Draven has tens of thousands!"

Cassian looked at the eighty people who'd chosen to trust him. It wasn't what he'd hoped for. But it was something.

"Then I'll fight with eighty," he said quietly. "And pray it's enough."

The King placed a hand on his shoulder. "The offer stays open. Tomorrow, when they see what you're willing to sacrifice, more may choose to help. But even if they don't..." He met Cassian's eyes. "You've still proven something important."

---

As the crowd dispersed—most returning to the city unconvinced—Torin approached.

"Eighty people," he said flatly. "Against Draven's thousands. The mathematics are not favorable."

"I know."

"You'll likely die."

"I know that too."

"But you're proceeding anyway."

"Yes." Cassian looked toward the mill, dark against the sunset. "Because maybe seeing me try—seeing me willing to die for them—will convince a few more to help. And a few more after that. It's a gamble. But it's the only move I have left."

Torin was quiet for a moment. "That's either wisdom or foolishness."

"Probably both," Cassian said.

---

They spent the night preparing for what would likely be a suicide mission.

Torin drilled his team on the Emissary locations. "We sever them during the fight. While Draven is occupied, we disconnect as many as possible. It won't defeat him—he'll still have thousands in reserve. But it might shift the balance enough for Cassian to survive a few minutes longer."

"A few minutes?" one refugee asked.

"That's optimistic," Torin said flatly.

Perin worked with the eighty volunteers who'd accepted the energy trade, teaching them how to consciously channel vitality through the Coin of Seeds. Most had never attempted anything like it. The transfer made them exhausted within minutes.

"This is all we have?" one merchant asked, looking pale. "Eighty tired people against ten thousand Hollow?"

"It's what we have," Perin said firmly. "And it's more than anyone's freely given to oppose him before."

Cassian stood alone in the courtyard, both coins burning in his palms. The Coin of Heads showed him the shimmer of value across the city—thousands of people, most skeptical, fearful, unwilling to commit. And beneath it all, Draven's network, vast and oppressive, feeding him power from an ocean of stolen souls.

Eighty connections versus ten thousand.

It wasn't a fight. It was martyrdom.

But maybe martyrdom had value too. Maybe seeing him die trying would inspire others. Maybe his sacrifice would plant seeds that grew into resistance later.

*Some things are worth pursuing even if the world calls you a fool for it.*

His father's words. Rowan had believed them until the end. Had died for them.

Tomorrow, Cassian would too.

Unless the crowd changed their minds.

---

Dawn came cold. The city was eerily quiet—everyone saving their energy for the spectacle at sunset.

Cassian tried to sleep but couldn't. His mind kept returning to Mira—still bound to Draven's authority through the oath she'd sworn. Trapped somewhere in Draven's stronghold, powerless to escape.

Their mental connection through the Coin of Heads remained. Cassian closed his eyes and reached through the connection, pushing past the familiar resistance.

And found it… different.

Draven was still dampening it, but it seemed more powerful than before. Like a curtain that had worn threadbare. He pushed harder, and suddenly—

—the world shifted.

He stood in the gray space. The liminal place between minds where the coins sometimes pulled their bearers.

Mira stood across from him, looking exhausted. Her eyes widened. "Cassian?"

"You're still bound to him," Cassian said, eyes dampening.

"It's not your fault." Her voice was steady, but he could feel her fear bleeding through their connection. "The Law enforces the bargain I made."

"I'll confront him tonight—"

"I know. I've heard everything through the bond." She stepped closer, and here in this mental space, he could feel her more clearly than he had in weeks. "You're going to die, Cassian. Eighty people against ten thousand? That's not a fight. That's martyrdom."

"Maybe." He reached out, and their hands met—not physically, but in the strange half-real way of this place. "But maybe seeing me try will convince others to help. Maybe sacrifice has its own kind of meaning."

Through their connection, he felt her anguish. "I don't want meaning. I want you alive."

"I want that too. But I can't run. Not when there's a chance—however slim—that this works."

Mira's expression crumpled. "Then I'll be trapped with him. Watching through this connection as he kills you. Unable to do anything."

"Or you'll watch me win."

"I afraid that won't happen..."

"Probably not." He pulled her closer—or the gray space pulled them together, he couldn't tell. "But I'm going to try anyway. Because some things are worth pursuing even if the world calls you a fool for it."

She recognized his father's words. Fresh tears spilled down her face. "Come back to me."

"I'll try." He paused, feeling the weight of everything unsaid between them. "If I don't—if this goes wrong—I need you to know that helping you in the market, finding the coins together, all of it... it mattered. You matter."

Through their connection, he felt her grief—raw and overwhelming. Not just fear for him, but fury at her own helplessness. Trapped by an oath she'd sworn to protect him, unable to do anything but watch.

"When this is over," she said quietly, "when you and Draven reach whatever understanding breaks this binding—we're going to have a long conversation about your definition of 'trying.'"

Despite everything, he almost smiled. "Deal."

The space began to fade. The connection couldn't hold much longer.

"Don't die," Mira said. Not a plea. A command.

"I'll do my best."

Then the gray space dissolved, and Cassian opened his eyes back in his room, alone.

His cheeks were wet.

---

By sunset, the plains were packed again. Even more people than the night before. Word had spread—the ledger-keeper was challenging the Supreme Voice. Most came to watch him die. Some came hoping for a miracle.

Cassian walked across the plains toward the mill, the eighty volunteers walking behind him in silent support. The crowd parted, watching. Judging. Waiting.

He could feel their doubt through the Coin of Heads. Most expected him to fail. Expected Draven to crush him within seconds. They'd come for a spectacle, not a battle.

*Let them watch,* Cassian thought. *Let them see what we're losing to.*

He reached the mill and turned to face the crowd. Thousands of people, all waiting.

"The offer still stands," he called out. "Your strength for my service. Given freely, withdrawn freely. I won't force anyone. But you can still choose to fight for freedom."

No one stepped forward. The crowd simply watched, silent.

Cassian nodded. He'd expected that. But he'd had to try.

He turned toward the mill just as Draven emerged.

The Supreme Voice looked exactly as Cassian remembered—handsome, composed, radiating confidence. The golden locket gleamed at his throat, containing the caged Coin of Waters. And somewhere within him, bonded and active, pulsed the Coin of Oxen.

"Cassian," Draven's voice carried across the plains, warm and cultured. "I'm glad you came. Shall we discuss terms like civilized men?"

"I'm here to fight," Cassian said. "Single combat. The Law as witness. If I win, you release those under your Hollow command--Mira included. If you win, I surrender my coins and serve your vision."

Draven smiled. "That's acceptable. Though I should warn you—you're going to lose. I have ten thousand Hollow feeding me an ocean of stolen power. This isn't a contest. It's a public execution."

"Then it should be easy for you."

"It will be." Draven removed his coat casually. "The Law recognizes our terms. Single combat. Winner takes all. Let's begin."

The Law settled over them both—heavy, binding, absolute.

Cassian reached through the Coin of Seeds, touching the eighty connections. Feeling the thin streams of vitality flowing into him. It wasn't much. Barely enough to make him faster, stronger than normal.

But it was freely given.

Draven charged.

The Coin of Oxen made him impossibly fast—one moment standing still, the next driving a fist toward Cassian's face with enough force to shatter stone.

Cassian moved, enhanced by the eighty connections, barely dodging. Draven's fist passed close enough to stir his hair, impacting the mill wall and punching clean through.

The crowd gasped.

Cassian didn't waste time. He drove forward, channeling the borrowed strength into a strike aimed at Draven's ribs. Connected. Felt the impact.

Draven barely staggered. "Impressive. You actually touched me. But look—"

He gestured to the hole in the wall. "That's what I can do with casual effort. What do you think happens when I actually try?"

He attacked again—faster, harder. The plains became a blur of motion. Every strike Draven threw carried lethal force. Every dodge Cassian managed was by the thinnest margin.

And slowly, inevitably, Cassian started taking hits.

A glancing blow to his shoulder sent him spinning. A kick to his ribs cracked bone. A fist that he only partially blocked broke his forearm.

Cassian collapsed, blood in his mouth, pain screaming through his body.

The crowd watched in stunned silence.

This was it. This was how it ended. Draven had been right—it wasn't a fight. It was an execution.

Draven walked toward him slowly, confidently. "I gave you every chance to avoid this. Every opportunity to serve willingly. But you chose martyrdom instead. So be it."

He raised his fist for the killing blow.

And Cassian felt something shift in the crowd.

Through the Coin of Heads, he sensed it—a ripple of emotion. Not pity exactly. But recognition. Hundreds of people watching a man die for them, seeing the gap between Draven's power and Cassian's sacrifice.

Seeing him choose to fight anyway.

One person in the crowd—a merchant Cassian had never met—made a choice. Accepted the trade. Offered their energy.

Then another.

And another.

The trickle became a stream.

As Draven's fist descended, Cassian suddenly felt power flood into him—not eighty connections anymore, but hundreds. Thousands. People across the plains making split-second decisions to trust him, to give freely, to prove that chosen cooperation could match stolen power.

Cassian moved.

His hand caught Draven's descending fist—stopped it cold. The impact sent shockwaves across the plains, but Cassian held firm, drawing on the vast wellspring of energy flowing into him.

Draven's eyes widened in shock. "How—"

Cassian rose, his broken bones knitting, his injuries fading as the crowd's energy poured healing into him. "Because of them. They believe in me. And they believe in freedom."

He twisted, throwing Draven back with force that made the ground crack.

For the first time, genuine fear flickered across Draven's face.

The fight had just begun.
