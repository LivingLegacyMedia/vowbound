# Chapter 19: What Can Be Freely Given

*Three hours earlier—while Cassian walked toward the aqueduct*

Torin descended into the Royal Library's restricted archives with the focused precision of someone who no longer required sleep.

The head archivist—Veldris, skeletal and ancient—gave him the key after reading King Aldric's authorization. "Third level. His Majesty's father sealed these chambers two years before he died. You're the first person granted access since."

Torin moved through narrow stone passages, lamp in hand. He'd been awake for thirty-six hours. Would have been impossible before Cassian's partial restoration. But his damaged mind compensated for its emotional hollows with enhanced capacity for sustained thought.

The third level chamber was cramped, dominated by a map covered in pins and threads. Research documents lay stacked on every surface—organized, methodical, obsessive.

Torin set the lamp down and began processing information.

**Hour One: Network Structure**

Field reports from someone named Seris—Guild researcher. Analysis of Draven's recruitment patterns. The network didn't spread randomly. It grew through specific nodes.

*Emissaries.*

Torin's analytical mind locked onto the pattern immediately. Individual Hollow weren't all connected directly to Draven. They connected through intermediaries. Conduits. Cut an Emissary, and everyone tethered through them would disconnect simultaneously.

Elegant system. But vulnerable.

**Hour Two: Failed Operations**

He found letters in handwriting he vaguely recognized. Rowan. Cassian's father.

*"Your Majesty,*

*The network grows through specific individuals—Emissaries who serve as anchor points. I've identified at least eight in the capital region. If we could sever them simultaneously, we might fragment Kane's entire operation.*

*I'm developing severance techniques. But I'll need authorization to act before he consolidates further.*

*Rowan"*

Dated a year ago.

A second document detailed an operation three months later—unauthorized. Rowan had severed two Emissaries. Disconnected approximately 600 Hollow. Results: catastrophic. The disconnected had no framework for recovery. Many died. Others begged to reconnect. Within days, Draven had repaired the network.

*Severance without restoration creates more suffering than it prevents.*

Torin processed this clinically. Rowan had the technique but lacked restoration capability. Cassian had both coins now. But did he have enough seed material to restore hundreds?

**Hour Three: The King's Death**

Hidden in a sealed drawer—a note dated three months ago:

*"Challenged Kane to single combat. The Coin of Oxen made him unstoppable. He broke me deliberately, left me to die slowly.*

*But I learned his weakness: Kane has no true allies. His power comes from taking, never receiving. He's forgotten what it means to be freely given anything.*

*Tell Aldric: Build what Kane can't. That's how you win."*

Cassian's father. Killed by Draven three months ago. The "carriage accident" had been a lie.

Torin sat back, constructing his analysis.

*Premise 1: Network operates through Emissaries.*
*Premise 2: Severing creates mass disconnection.*
*Premise 3: Disconnection without restoration fails.*
*Premise 4: Cassian has restoration capability Rowan lacked.*
*Premise 5: But individual seed material won't scale to hundreds.*

*Conclusion: Success requires distributed contribution.*

Who would give freely? Who would volunteer pieces of themselves?

Torin thought of Perin, the freed emissary. The refugees. Cassian himself, who helped without transactional motive.

*Illogical by pure efficiency metrics. But effective.*

Maybe that was the point.

**Hour Four: Veylin Marr**

Intelligence reports on current Emissaries. Fourteen total. Veylin Marr commanded the largest network: 600-800 Hollow. Based in the eastern district.

The woman who'd recruited him. Who'd given him Draven's locket to offer Mira.

Torin felt something flicker in the void—not quite emotion, but recognition. If they severed Veylin, they'd fragment Draven's largest power base.

And free the network that had consumed him.

He made detailed notes. Warehouse layout. Guard patterns. Entry points. By dawn, he had a complete operational plan.

---

Cassian returned just before sunrise, exhausted from the aqueduct confrontation. Torin intercepted him in the eastern wing.

"I found the network architecture," Torin said without preamble. "Your father discovered it years ago. Attempted severance but failed—no restoration capability. You have both tools now."

He handed Cassian his notes.

"You researched all night?" Cassian asked.

"Thirty-six hours. Don't require sleep anymore." Torin tapped the documents. "Emissary system. Hierarchical structure. Sever an Emissary, disconnect everyone tethered through them. Your father tried. It failed because the disconnected had nowhere to go."

"How many per Emissary?"

"Veylin Marr commands 600-800."

Cassian's expression darkened. "Veylin. She took Mira."

"If we disconnect her, we fragment his largest network."

"We?"

"I can perform the severance. You taught me the technique when you freed me. While you meet Draven tomorrow, I lead a team to her warehouse. Sever the connection. You provide restoration energy."

"That's what my father tried. It failed."

"You have something he didn't." Torin paused. "The coin of seeds. But there's no way you can pay the price of restoring 800 souls. Not alone."

"Then what—"

"Distributed contribution. Multiple volunteers offering fragments. Building what Draven can't—a network based on choice."

Cassian studied the documents, silent for a long moment.

"Your father wrote that," Torin added. "His final instruction before Draven killed him three months ago."

---

King Aldric arranged a small meeting that morning. Perin arrived with Elena. Three refugees. Captain Drenneth. The King himself.

Torin presented his findings with mechanical precision. The Emissary structure. Veylin's network. The operational plan.

"The critical gap is restoration material," Torin explained. "800 people require seed fragments. Cassian can provide some, but not enough alone."

"I'll contribute what I can," Perin said immediately. "Not much—I'm still rebuilding. But I have memories now. Emotions. If small pieces help..."

"I have anger," one refugee said. "Anger at what they did. If that helps someone fight back..."

Another nodded. "I remember realizing I was hollow. The horror. Maybe someone needs that to understand what was done to them."

One by one, they offered fragments.

"This is it," the King said quietly. "What my father meant. Draven built his empire on taking. We're building ours on giving."

But Cassian looked troubled. "It's not enough. Even with everyone contributing, we don't have material for hundreds. And memory trades are too nuanced—I can't broker them in bulk. It's not scalable."

Silence.

Then Torin spoke: "The Coin of Seeds doesn't just broker memories. It channels growth energy. Vitality. Life force."

"Yes, but—"

"What if people offered that instead? Not complex memories requiring individual negotiation. Simple vitality. Energy they could give consciously, channeled through you to the disconnected."

Cassian's eyes widened. "Use the Coin of Seeds to create a network. People offering energy willingly, flowing through me to those who need restoration."

"A voluntary network," the King said. "The opposite of what Draven built."

"But who would agree to that?" Perin asked. "Giving away their energy to a stranger? That's exhausting. Dangerous even."

"People who believe in what you're fighting for," the King said. "People who see you standing against Draven and choose to support you."

"You're talking about the whole town," Cassian said. "Most of them don't even know me. Why would they—"

"Make the offer," Torin interrupted. "Present it as a choice. 'Your energy, to me. In exchange, I fight for you.' Let them decide."

"And if they refuse?"

"Then we proceed with what we have." Torin's expression didn't change. "But if they accept... you'd have power Draven can't match. He draws from enslaved victims. You'd draw from willing supporters."

Cassian thought of Draven's network—thousands of Hollow feeding him power involuntarily. Versus what Torin proposed: people consciously choosing to lend strength.

The Law would recognize both. But one was theft, the other a gift.

"I'll make the offer," Cassian said slowly. "Before I meet Draven. Give people the choice. If enough accept..."

"You'll be fast enough, strong enough to match his Coin of Oxen," Torin finished.

"Wait," Captain Drenneth said. "You're planning to fight Draven? Physically?"

"Why not?" Cassian met his eyes. "He'll expect me to try negotiation, manipulation, clever tactics. He won't expect a direct challenge. And if I can draw on willing support while he's distracted fighting me..."

"Torin and I sever the Emissaries," Perin said, understanding. "Drain his network while he's occupied."

"Exactly."

"That's insane," Drenneth muttered. But he was smiling. "Completely insane. Challenge a man with superhuman strength to single combat while your friends sabotage his power source."

"My father tried wisdom," Cassian said. "The King's father tried strength. Both failed because they fought alone. Maybe what works is fighting together—with people who choose to stand with you."

The King nodded slowly. "My father's last words: 'Build what Kane can't.' This is it, isn't it? A network based on trust instead of theft."

"If enough people accept the offer," Cassian said.

"They will," Perin said quietly. "People want to believe generosity can stand against cruelty. Give them the chance to prove it."

---

They spent the day preparing. Torin mapped Veylin's warehouse. Drenneth positioned soldiers. Cassian practiced channeling energy through the Coin of Seeds—taking Perin's offered vitality and redirecting it, learning to be a conduit rather than just a source.

It was exhausting. Even small amounts of transferred energy left him drained. If he tried to channel hundreds of people simultaneously...

"You'll burn out," Torin observed. "The volume will overwhelm you."

"Then I'll burn out fighting," Cassian said. "Better than watching Draven win."

As evening approached, the King made an announcement. A town gathering at the old mill. Tomorrow at sunset. The King's ledger-keeper would speak about the Hollow threat.

"Will they come?" Cassian asked.

"They'll come," the King said. "Whether they listen is another question."

---

That night, Cassian couldn't sleep. He stood in the palace courtyard under stars, both coins burning in his palms.

Tomorrow he'd walk to the mill. Make an offer to a town that barely knew him. Ask them to give freely of their strength to power a fight against an enemy most didn't believe existed.

And if they refused, he'd face Draven alone.

He felt the thread to Mira pulse weakly—still dampened, but present.

*I'm trying to be smarter than my father,* he sent along the connection. *Trying to build what Draven can't. I don't know if it'll work.*

No response. Just that faint warmth.

Cassian closed his eyes, thinking through the plan one more time.

Torin and Perin would target Veylin and at least two other major Emissaries. Sever them simultaneously. Disconnect perhaps 2,000 Hollow total. While Draven reeled from that disruption, Cassian would challenge him to single combat—binding the confrontation by the Law so Draven couldn't simply walk away.

If enough townspeople accepted the energy-offering trade, Cassian would have the strength to match Draven's Coin of Oxen. If they didn't... well, he'd try anyway.

It was desperate. Fragile. Built on hope that people would choose to help.

But it was also the only plan that felt right.

"Some things are worth pursuing even if the world calls you a fool for it."

His father's words. Rowan had died believing them eight years ago—or three months ago, Cassian still wasn't sure which timeline was accurate. The King's father had died believing them three months ago.

Tomorrow, Cassian would find out if they were right.

---

Dawn came cold and bright. Cassian dressed simply—worker's clothes, not finery. If he was asking the town to trust him, he needed to look like one of them.

Perin arrived early with Elena. "She wanted to see you before..." He didn't finish.

Elena looked up at Cassian with solemn eyes. "Papa says you're going to fight the bad man."

"I'm going to try."

"Will you win?"

"I don't know."

She thought about that, then nodded. "Papa says sometimes trying is more important than winning. Because if you don't try, you already lost."

Cassian knelt down to her level. "Your papa is very wise."

"I know." She threw her arms around his neck, hugging him fiercely. "Be careful. And come back. Papa needs you to finish fixing him."

Cassian's throat tightened. "I will."

---

By sunset, the team was assembled. Torin, Perin, three refugees, Drenneth's soldiers. Each one prepared for their role.

"Veylin's warehouse has three entry points," Torin reviewed one final time. "We split into three teams. Simultaneous breach. I locate Veylin, sever her connection. Perin, you handle the secondary Emissaries—I've marked their probable locations."

"What if Draven detects the disruption?" one refugee asked.

"He will," Cassian said. "But he'll be occupied. I'm going to challenge him to single combat. Bind it by the Law. He won't be able to respond to the network disruption without breaking the terms."

"And if you can't match his strength?"

"Then I die. But at least you'll have time to free as many as possible."

Silence.

"That's not going to happen," Perin said fiercely. "The town will accept your offer. They'll give you the strength you need."

"You don't know that."

"I know people want to believe generosity matters. Give them the chance."

The King approached with the bronze medallion. "My father wanted you to carry this. Proof of royal authorization. And a reminder of what you're fighting for."

Cassian took it, feeling its weight.

"Whatever happens," the King said quietly, "you've already proven that Draven is wrong. You've already shown that people can choose to help each other. That's worth everything."

---

The mill square was crowded by the time Cassian arrived. Hundreds of people—merchants, laborers, refugees, nobles. More than he'd expected. The King had spread word well.

Cassian stood on the mill steps, looking out at the faces. So many strangers. So many reasons to doubt.

He pulled out both coins, holding them high enough to see.

"My name is Cassian," he said, his voice carrying across the square. "Some of you know me. Most don't. But you all know about the Hollow. You've heard the stories. Seen the refugees. Maybe lost someone to Draven Kane's network."

Murmurs of agreement.

"Tomorrow I'm going to fight him. Challenge him to single combat. It won't end his army—but it might give us a chance to free some of those he's enslaved."

"How?" someone shouted. "You're just a ledger-keeper!"

"I have these." Cassian raised the coins higher. "Artifacts that let me broker trades. Perceive value. And channel energy given freely."

He took a breath. This was it.

"I'm making you an offer. Your strength, your vitality, given to me. In exchange, I fight for you. Protect this town. Try to stop Draven from claiming anyone else. The Law will recognize it as a fair trade—your temporary energy for my commitment to your defense."

Silence.

"I can't force you," Cassian continued. "The trade only works if you accept freely. Willingly. If you refuse, I fight alone. But if you accept..." He looked across the crowd. "If you accept, I'll have strength Draven's stolen power can never match. Because you'll have chosen to give it."

More silence. Then a voice from the back: "Why should we trust you?"

Cassian recognized widow Marta—the woman from Southgate he'd helped with the tax records. "You shouldn't," he said honestly. "I'm not asking for trust. I'm asking for a choice. Give freely, or don't. Either way, I'm fighting tomorrow. But I'd rather fight with your support than without it."

Widow Marta stepped forward. "You corrected the tax ledgers. Cost yourself your position. Helped my district when you had no reason to."

"That was just—"

"Just?" She laughed. "Boy, nothing is 'just' anything in this world. You chose to help. No transaction. No payment. Just because it was right." She looked at the crowd. "I'll take his offer. My strength to him. For as long as he fights for us."

One person. Cassian felt the Coin of Seeds pulse, recognizing the offer.

Then Perin stepped forward. "Mine too. My strength and Elena's future. For what you've done and what you'll do."

Two people.

Then one of the refugees: "You restored me. Gave me pieces of yourself. I give mine back freely. To help you fight."

Three.

Four.

Five.

Like a dam breaking, people began stepping forward. Not everyone—maybe half the crowd stood back, unwilling or skeptical. But half accepted.

Cassian felt the offers through the Coin of Seeds—a growing web of connections. People willingly giving small portions of their vitality, channeled through him, ready to be used in their defense.

It wasn't the same as Draven's network. These people could withdraw consent at any time. Could stop giving if they chose. But for now, they were offering freely.

Cassian looked across the crowd, overwhelmed. "Thank you," he said. "I'll fight with everything you've given. Everything I am. And I'll try to be worthy of your choice."

---

As the crowd dispersed, Torin approached. "Approximately 200 people accepted. That's substantial energy. If you can channel it effectively during combat—"

"I know." Cassian felt the connections thrumming through the Coin of Seeds. Power. Potential. All given freely. "Let's not waste it."

They moved as planned. Torin's team toward the eastern district. Drenneth's soldiers to observation positions. Cassian toward the mill to wait for Draven.

The old building loomed ahead—dark, isolated. Cassian could sense Draven inside, waiting.

He touched both coins through his shirt, feeling their heat. And beyond them, the web of connections to 200 people who'd chosen to trust him with their strength.

*This is it,* he thought. *The moment we find out if freely given can stand against forcibly taken.*

He walked toward the mill.

Behind him, across the city, Torin's team moved into position at Veylin's warehouse.

Ready to attempt the impossible.

Ready to prove that cooperation could stand against compulsion.

Ready to start building something new.
