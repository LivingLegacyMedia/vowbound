# Chapter 19: The Thread Between Minds

The connection was fragile—like hearing a voice through walls and water, distant but unmistakable.

*...Cassian?*

Cassian's heart lurched. He focused harder on the thread, pouring his awareness along its length. The Coin of Heads burned hot in his palm, responding to his desperate need.

*Mira. I can hear you. Where are you?*

Silence. The thread wavered, threatening to dissolve.

Then, fainter than before: *Underground. Stone walls. Three levels down, he said. I can see... bars on a window. Sunlight but I can't reach it.*

*Who has you? Veylin?*

*No. She brought me here but... Draven. He's here. He showed me—*

The connection fractured. Cassian felt Mira's presence recede like a tide pulling back from shore. He pushed harder, trying to maintain contact, but something was interfering. Another presence, cold and calculating, pressing against the thread.

And then, cutting through the static like a blade:

*Hello, Cassian.*

Draven's voice. Smooth, cultured, utterly in control.

Cassian's eyes snapped open. He was back in his quarters, heart pounding, the coin hot enough to burn. Sweat soaked his shirt.

The thread was still there—thinner now, barely perceptible. But along it, he could sense Draven's awareness. Not speaking, just... watching. Evaluating. Amused.

*He knows I can reach her,* Cassian realized. *He wanted me to make contact. This is part of his plan.*

But the connection had worked. For a few seconds, he'd touched Mira's mind. Heard her thoughts. And more importantly, she'd shared location details: underground, three levels, barred window facing sunlight.

It wasn't much. But it was something.

Cassian stood, tucking both coins into his shirt, and went to find the King.

---

King Aldric's study was dimly lit, the King hunched over maps of the capital with Captain Drenneth. They both looked up when Cassian entered.

"I made contact with her," Cassian said without preamble. "Through the coins. Mira's alive and conscious. She gave me details about her location."

Drenneth straightened immediately. "How precise?"

"Underground facility, three levels deep, with a barred window that catches sunlight. Stone walls. She said 'he brought her there'—meaning someone moved her from wherever Veylin initially handed her over."

"That describes half a dozen locations in the city," Drenneth said, already moving to a different map—this one showing the city's underground infrastructure. "Old merchant vaults beneath Guild Row. Wine cellars under the noble quarter. The grain storage beneath the eastern market. The abandoned—"

"Wait." Cassian closed his eyes, focusing on the thread to Mira. It was faint, but present. He let the Coin of Heads guide his perception, following the connection like a strand of spider silk stretching across the city. "I can sense direction. She's... north. North and slightly east from here."

He opened his eyes, moving to the map. "Here. Somewhere in this quadrant."

Drenneth traced the area with his finger. "That narrows it to three possibilities. The old aqueduct terminus, the wine merchant's vault, or the northern watchtower basement." He glanced at the King. "We've had reports of unusual activity around the aqueduct for the past week. Hollow moving in and out at odd hours."

The King's expression darkened. "The aqueduct terminus. It's been abandoned for twenty years, but..." He touched a point on the map. "Draven used it as a meeting place once before. Three months ago. We found evidence after he'd already left—signs that he'd been operating there for a while."

Cassian felt the thread pulse faintly, as if in confirmation. "That's it," he said. "That's where she is."

"How many guards?" Cassian asked.

"If it's the terminus? Could be anywhere from twenty to a hundred." Drenneth's expression was grim. "The facility is massive—easily defensible, multiple exits, designed to withstand siege. If Draven's fortified it properly, we'd need a full company to breach it safely."

"Which would take time to organize," the King said. "And alert every Hollow sympathizer in the city that we're coming."

"So we don't breach it," Cassian said. "I go in quietly. Find Mira. Extract her before anyone realizes I'm there."

Both men stared at him.

Drenneth said flatly, "You're barely recovered from the last extraction. You have no intelligence about the interior layout. And Draven is almost certainly waiting for exactly this response."

"He's waiting for me to act emotionally, yes." Cassian's voice steadied as he thought it through. "But that's why this approach works. He expects panic or caution—either a reckless charge or careful intelligence gathering. Walking in to negotiate subverts both expectations."

"How is walking into his stronghold not reckless?" Drenneth demanded.

"Because I'm not going to fight him." Cassian met his eyes. "Draven values converts more than corpses. He wants me to choose his side, which means he'll talk. And while he talks, I learn—about his defenses, his plans, his blind spots. The Coin of Heads shows me value patterns, what people truly want. Five minutes of conversation with Draven will teach me more than five days of surveillance."

"And if you're wrong?" Drenneth asked. "If he just captures you the moment you walk in?"

"Then I'll use what I learned when we escaped the facility." Cassian touched the Coin of Seeds. "Between the two coins, I can perceive opportunities and create them. Plant seeds of doubt in his people, accelerate weaknesses in structures, negotiate my way through gaps in his authority." He paused. "I'm not the same person who went into that recruitment center. I've been learning. Growing. Every confrontation teaches me something new."

The King studied him for a long moment, then said, "You've proven yourself very resourceful, Cassian. I don't want to lose you, but I trust your judgment."

"Then help me," Cassian said. "Your intelligence network—has anyone tracked where Draven might be operating from? Where he'd take prisoners?"

Drenneth moved back to the map. "We've had reports of increased activity around the old aqueduct terminus. It's been abandoned for twenty years, but—"

"That's where I met him before," Cassian interrupted. "When Mira..." He didn't finish. "He knows the layout. Probably fortified it."

"Which makes it a terrible place for a rescue," Drenneth said. "Multiple levels, dozens of rooms, easily defended."

"But predictable," the King said thoughtfully. "Draven is methodical. He wouldn't move a high-value prisoner without preparation. If she's there, she'll be in one of the lower holding chambers—the ones with the ventilation windows."

Cassian felt the thread to Mira pulse faintly, as if confirming it.

"I need information," he said, thinking aloud. "Not about the location—I can find her. But about Draven himself. What he's planning. What he really wants."

He looked at the King. "The Royal Library—does it have records on the coins? Ancient artifacts? Anything about the Law of Balance?"

Aldric's expression shifted slightly. "The deep archives have some materials. Mostly legends, fragmentary histories. My father spent considerable time in those archives, researching the coins. When I was young, I remember him disappearing down there for days at a time, coming back exhausted, troubled. Eventually he sealed off an entire section—said the knowledge was too dangerous to leave accessible."

Cassian's pulse quickened. His father had sealed research about the coins. Research important enough to lock away.

"I need access to those archives," Cassian said.

"Normally, I'd insist on accompanying you. But we don't have time for normal procedures." The King walked to his desk and wrote something on a piece of parchment. "This grants you access to the restricted sections. The head archivist will show you to my father's sealed chamber. But I should warn you—whatever he found troubled him greatly. Changed him, in his final years."

Cassian took the parchment, folding it carefully. Then a thought struck him.

"Torin," he said. "Where is he? Still in the palace?"

"East wing. With Perin and Elena. Why?"

Because Cassian couldn't be in two places at once. Couldn't research his father's discoveries while also preparing to infiltrate the aqueduct terminus. And Torin—damaged but functional, analytical to a fault—might be the perfect person to dig through complex historical research.

Ten minutes later, Torin arrived—expressionless as ever, but there was a sharpness in his eyes that hadn't been there before. The partial restoration was holding. He was still damaged, but present.

"Torin," Cassian said. "I need you to do something for me. Something important."

"Specify."

Cassian handed him the parchment. "Take this to the Royal Library. Go to the deep archives, three levels down. There's a sealed chamber—my father's research. I need you to find it, study everything inside, and report back with anything that might help us stop Draven. Particularly anything about multiple coins or a crown."

Torin took the key, studying it with the same analytical focus he applied to everything. "Time frame?"

"I'll give you until tomorrow morning. I'm going after Mira tonight."

"Probability of success?"

Cassian hesitated, then chose honesty. "Hard to say. But I have variables in my favor—Draven wants to recruit me, not kill me. And I'm bringing knowledge he doesn't expect me to have."

Torin was quiet for a moment, processing. Then: "Division of labor. Attempting both intelligence gathering and rescue operation simultaneously would reduce effectiveness of both. Separation increases overall probability of positive outcome."

"Exactly," Cassian said, relieved Torin understood.

"I'll complete the research assignment." Torin turned to leave, then paused. Something flickered in his eyes—brief, barely there. "Mira asked me to protect you once. After the restoration. If this research helps you survive the confrontation with Draven..."

He didn't finish the sentence, but he didn't need to.

"Thank you, Torin."

"Don't thank me." But the flicker in his eyes suggested otherwise. He left without another word, the parchment clutched in his mechanical grip.

Drenneth watched him go, then turned to Cassian. "You're really doing this."

"Yes."

"Then at least let me give you support. I'll position a squad near the terminus—out of sight, but close enough to intervene if things go wrong."

Cassian considered it, then shook his head. "Draven will sense them through his network. Anyone within a half-mile radius who's hollow or connected to someone hollow becomes his eyes and ears. He'll know I didn't come alone, and it gives him leverage to refuse negotiation."

"So you're going completely alone? Into a fortified position held by a man with two coins and an army of Hollow?" Drenneth's expression was grim.

"Not helpless." Cassian tapped the coins in his pocket. "I'm bringing tools he can't fully counter. The Coin of Heads lets me see through deceptions, understand true motives, find weaknesses in his arguments. The Coin of Seeds gives me options for escape or leverage he won't anticipate." He met Drenneth's eyes. "And I'm bringing something more dangerous than either coin—the willingness to listen. Draven wants to explain himself, justify his vision. People always reveal more than they intend when they think they're winning."

The King nodded slowly. "There's wisdom in that. Draven respects power, but he values converts more. Someone who chooses to join him willingly is worth more to his cause than another Hollow servant."

"Exactly," Cassian said. "So I go alone. I listen. I learn what I can about his plans, his weaknesses, his true goals. And I buy time for Torin to finish researching whatever your father discovered."

Drenneth didn't look happy, but he nodded. "At least take a signal flare. If everything goes wrong, light it. I'll have people watching from a distance—far enough that Draven won't sense them as a threat, close enough to see a flare. They won't be able to breach and extract you, but they can create a distraction. Give you a chance to run."

"All right," Cassian agreed. "That's reasonable."

Drenneth retrieved a small cylindrical device from a cabinet—about the size of a writing quill, capped with red wax. "Break the seal, point it skyward, and it'll burn bright enough to see from half the city. After that, you'll have maybe five minutes before my people arrive. Use them wisely."

Cassian tucked the flare into his coat pocket.

The King walked Cassian to the door. "Your father would be proud," he said quietly. "Not because you're risking everything for someone you care about—that's just human. But because you're doing it while still trying to protect others. That's wisdom."

"Or stupidity," Cassian said.

"Often the same thing, in the moment." The King's smile was sad. "Good luck, Cassian. Bring her back safely. And yourself, if possible."

---

Cassian left the palace as the sun touched the western horizon, slipping out through a servant's entrance to avoid attention. The city was settling into evening—shops closing, lanterns being lit, people heading home for dinner.

He moved through the streets with practiced invisibility, just another clerk heading home late. But his mind was racing, the coins burning against his chest.

The thread to Mira was still there. Thinner now, barely perceptible. But present.

As he walked, Cassian risked reaching out again, gently probing the connection.

*Mira? Can you hear me?*

Silence. Then, so faint he almost missed it:

*He knows. Cassian, he knows you're coming. He's been... talking to me. About the coins. About you. He showed me something. A crown. Seven empty settings. He wants to—*

Draven's presence slammed into the connection like a hammer.

*Enough.*

The thread went dark. Not severed, but blocked. Draven's will pressing down on it like a hand covering a flame.

Cassian stumbled, catching himself against a wall. Several passersby glanced at him curiously, then hurried on.

He took a shuddering breath. The connection was still there—he could feel it beneath Draven's interference. But he couldn't reach Mira anymore. Not without confronting Draven directly.

*Fine,* Cassian thought. *If that's what it takes.*

He continued north, toward the old aqueduct terminus.

---

The terminus rose from the northern district like a monument to abandoned ambition—three stories of weathered stone, arched entrances long since bricked over, windows dark and empty. Weeds grew between the paving stones of the surrounding courtyard.

Cassian circled the perimeter from a distance, using the Coin of Heads to perceive the building's value patterns.

And there—faint but unmistakable—the shimmer of human presence inside. Multiple people. At least twenty, maybe more. Most of them concentrated on the lower levels, precisely where Mira had said she was being held.

But there was something else. A stronger presence, higher up. On the third level, near what had once been the main reservoir chamber. Watching. Waiting. The value signature was unlike anything Cassian had felt before—dense, almost oppressive, like gravity itself had weight.

Draven.

Cassian could feel him now that he was close enough—a distortion in the normal flow of value, like a stone creating ripples in a stream. The man's very existence bent the Law around him, pulling resources toward himself while distributing costs outward to his network.

*He knows I'm here,* Cassian realized. *He's been waiting. This could be a trap.*

For a moment, he considered retreating. Calling for Drenneth's distant watchers, mounting a proper assault, approaching this with strategy instead of desperation.

But the thread to Mira pulsed weakly, and he could feel her fear along it. Distant, muted, but real. And he had less than twenty-four hours before Draven made his move on the city.

*If it's a trap, it's one I have to walk into anyway.*

Cassian found the eastern loading dock entrance—exactly where Drenneth's intelligence had predicted—and slipped inside.

The interior was dark, lit only by occasional oil lamps placed at intersections. The air smelled of damp stone and rust. Cassian moved quietly through the corridors, guided by the shimmer of human presence below.

Down one level. Two. Three.

At the third level, the corridor opened into a storage chamber—and there, in a cell formed by iron bars, was Mira.

She looked up as he approached, her eyes widening. For a moment, pure relief flooded her face. Then horror.

"Cassian, run! It's a—"

"Trap?" a voice finished smoothly.

Cassian spun.

Draven Kane stood at the corridor entrance, backlit by lamplight. Cassian recognized him instantly from the aqueduct—the same handsome severity, the same impeccable bearing, the same air of absolute control. Around his neck hung a golden locket—the Coin of Oxen inside, its black face covered to redirect the cost onto his network. At his belt, a second smaller locket held the Coin of Waters.

"Hello again, Cassian," Draven said, his voice cultured and warm. "I knew you'd come. We have so much more to discuss than our last conversation allowed."

Behind him, figures emerged from the shadows. Not guards. Hollow. Their eyes empty, their movements synchronized. Twenty of them, blocking the only exit.

Cassian reached for his coins, but Draven raised a hand.

"Please. There's no need for violence. I have no intention of harming you." He smiled. "In fact, I've been looking forward to this conversation for quite some time. You and I, Cassian, are more alike than you realize."

"I'm nothing like you," Cassian said.

"Aren't you?" Draven walked closer, his steps measured and confident. "You use the coins to perceive value, to broker trades, to take from one and give to another. You've learned to sever the hollow from my network—a skill I didn't expect anyone to develop. The only difference between us is that I've been more ambitious. More willing to see the work through to its conclusion."

He gestured to Mira's cell. "She told you I showed her the crown, I assume? The Crown of Aram. Seven medallions, seven domains of power. I have two coins now—Oxen, which you've seen, and Waters, which I acquired last year. You have two as well—Heads and Seeds. The remaining three are scattered across the kingdoms, but I'm narrowing down their locations."

Cassian's mind raced. Two coins. Draven had bonded with two, just like him.

"How?" Cassian demanded.

"I make them submit. Oxen dominates the others. Bends them to my will."

He touched the locket hanging from his neck. "When I claim all seven..." His eyes gleamed. "I'll have power beyond anything this world has seen in a thousand years."

"To do what?" Cassian demanded. "Rule? Conquer?"

"To *fix*." Draven's voice was fervent. "This world is broken, Cassian. People suffer because resources are scarce, because power is concentrated, because the Law of Balance punishes the weak and rewards the ruthless. But with all seven coins unified in the crown, I can reshape the fundamental rules of exchange. Make abundance universal. Make suffering a choice rather than an inevitability. Create a world where no one needs to trade away their humanity just to survive."

"By hollowing them first," Cassian said. "By making them empty so you can fill them with whatever you want them to be."

"By offering them a choice," Draven corrected. "Accept the trade—suffering for peace—or keep struggling. Most choose peace. And who am I to deny them?"

"They don't understand what they're giving up," Cassian said. "You manipulate them into accepting."

"I offer clarity. The Law accepts their consent. That's all that matters." Draven's smile widened. "But I didn't bring you here to debate philosophy. We both know you can't stop me through force. Your little escape at the aqueduct was impressive, but temporary. I still have my network. Still have thousands who've accepted my vision."

He paused, his expression darkening slightly. "Your father understood that, eventually. Three months ago, he discovered I was collecting the coins. He tried to convince me to stop. When I refused, he challenged me to single combat—insisted on it, actually. Very noble. Very foolish." Draven touched the locket dangling at his chest. "The Coin of Oxen grants me strength beyond mortal limits. Your father fought bravely, but he was no match for me."

Cassian's blood went cold. "You... you fought my father?"

"I broke him," Draven said quietly. "Shattered his ribs, ruptured internal organs. The Coin of Oxen doesn't grant finesse, but it does grant overwhelming force. I left him alive. But the injuries..." He shrugged. "He made it home. Died three days later. I heard the official story was a carriage accident."

The world seemed to narrow to a single point. Three months of questions. Three months of believing his father had died in a tragic accident. And all that time, it had been because he'd challenged Draven. Because he'd tried to stop the man standing in front of him.

"You're lying," Cassian said, but his voice shook.

"Why would I lie? Your father was a good man—intelligent, principled, willing to die for his convictions. I respected him, even as I destroyed him. He understood what I was trying to do and chose to oppose it anyway. That takes courage." Draven's expression was almost sympathetic. "I'm telling you this because I want you to understand the stakes. Your father challenged me believing conviction would overcome raw power. It didn't. He crawled home to die. You're smarter than he was. You can see this isn't a fight you can win."

Rage surged through Cassian—white-hot, blinding. Every muscle screamed at him to attack, to make Draven pay, to—

Through the thread, he felt Mira's terror spike.

Draven hadn't moved, but something had shifted in the air. Mira gasped, her hand going to her throat. When she pulled it away, her fingertips were wet with blood. A thin trickle ran from her nose.

"Stop," Draven said calmly. "Or I continue."

Cassian froze, his hand hovering over the Coin of Heads. Through their connection, he could sense what was happening—Mira's blood vessels straining, pressure building in her lungs, fluid beginning to seep where it shouldn't.

"The Coin of Waters," Draven explained, his voice conversational, "allows me to manipulate any liquid. Blood. Lymph. The fluid in your lungs." He gestured casually. "I can make someone drown on dry land. Burst their vessels from the inside. It's quite effective. And because I have my network—twenty Hollow in this building alone—I can distribute the cost of the trade across them. They bear the suffering. The Law accepts it. I remain unharmed."

Mira coughed, red flecking her lips.

"Let her go," Cassian said through gritted teeth.

"When we're finished talking, certainly."

Rage still burned in Cassian's chest, but beneath it was something colder. His father had challenged Draven, driven by conviction and righteousness. And Draven had killed him. Now Cassian stood in the same position—wanting to fight, to avenge, to strike down this man who'd caused so much suffering.

But his father had lost because he'd fought on emotion. On principle.

Cassian forced himself to breathe. To think.

"What do you want?" he asked.

Draven smiled—pleased, like a teacher whose student had finally grasped a difficult concept. "Better. Much better." He released whatever pressure he'd been applying through the Coin of Waters. Mira sagged against the cell bars, gasping.

"The connection you forged with her," Draven continued, "is remarkable. I can sense it—a thread between your minds. I lack your coin's particular gift for direct mental manipulation, but I can affect her physically." He tilted his head thoughtfully. "It's an elegant solution to a problem. You care about her. Deeply, I think. Which means you'll listen."

He began pacing, hands clasped behind his back. "Here's my offer. You have two coins. I have two. Together, we have four of the seven. We're both searching for the remaining three. We could fight—waste time, resources, lives—trying to claim them separately. Or we could cooperate. Pool our knowledge. Find the last three coins together, then decide how to use them."

"I would never help you," Cassian said.

"Not even to save her?" Draven gestured to Mira. "Not even to buy time to find another solution? I'm not asking for your loyalty, Cassian. Just a temporary truce. A business arrangement between two professionals."

"And after we find the coins?"

"Then we negotiate properly. Perhaps you'll convince me that my vision is flawed. Perhaps I'll convince you that peace is worth the price." Draven's smile widened slightly. "Or perhaps the Law will make the choice for us. But we'll have time to explore the possibilities. Time your resistance network desperately needs, given how many Hollow I control in this city alone."

Cassian looked past Draven to Mira. She was watching him intently, blood still on her lips. Her expression was complicated—fear, yes, but something else too. Determination. She gave a tiny shake of her head.

*Don't,* she mouthed silently. *Don't trust him.*

But what choice did he have?

"I need proof," Cassian said slowly. "Proof that you'll honor any agreement."

"Reasonable." Draven considered. "What would satisfy you?"

"Release her. Now. Before we negotiate anything else."

Draven laughed—genuinely amused. "And lose my leverage? No. But I will offer her something more interesting than simple release." He walked closer to Mira's cell, studying her with the focused interest of a chess player contemplating his next move. "Tell me, girl—do you remember why you stole Cassian's coin in the first place?"

Through the thread, Cassian felt Mira's shame and confusion spike.

"To save her brother," Cassian said. "You manipulated her—"

"I offered her a choice," Draven corrected. "Save someone she loved, or protect someone she barely knew. She chose love over principle. It's what most people do." He turned to Mira. "And when I'm done with this conversation, you'll have another choice. A better one."

He pulled a key from his coat pocket and unlocked the cell door, swinging it open. Mira stared at it, not moving.

"Here's what I find fascinating, Cassian," Draven continued, his voice pleasant, almost conversational. "You forgave her. More than that—you connected your mind to hers. Created a bond through the Coin of Heads. That connection is... valuable."

Cassian felt a chill run through him. Through their thread, he sensed Draven's awareness pressing against the link like fingers testing a rope's strength.

"The connection runs both ways." His smile widened. "Which brings me to my offer."

He turned fully to Mira now. "You can leave this cell. Walk out. Go home. I won't stop you. But there's a price—there's always a price. The connection you have to Cassian's coin, I want it. Surrender it to me voluntarily. Let me take that thread, that access. With it, I can sense when Cassian uses his power. Track him. Perhaps even... influence the coin's gifts through the link you share."

"No," Cassian said immediately. "Mira, don't—"

"But in exchange," Draven continued, speaking over Cassian, "I'll do more than let you go. I'll give back what I took from your brother. Restore him. Fully. Completely. Everything you wanted when you first came to me. Everything you sacrificed Cassian for before—you'll get it. Freedom. Your brother whole. Your debt to me forgiven."

Mira's breath caught. Through their connection, Cassian felt the surge of hope and longing. Torin. Whole. The thing she'd wanted more than anything.

"Or," Draven said, his voice quieter now, "you can refuse. Keep that connection to yourself. Protect Cassian and his coin. But if you do, you'll need to give me something else of equal value. Something to ensure Cassian comes to our meeting tomorrow with an open mind."

"What?" Mira's voice was barely a whisper.

"Yourself. Bind yourself to my authority. Submit voluntarily—swear by the Law—until Cassian and I reach an understanding. The Coin of Oxen grants dominion to those who willingly accept it. You would become... let's say, indentured. Unable to leave. Unable to resist my commands. Your brother would stay as he is—damaged, incomplete. But Cassian would keep his secrets, and you would keep your integrity."

The air seemed to thicken. Cassian felt the weight of the proposed trade settling over them like a storm front.

"That's not a choice," Cassian said. "That's extortion."

"It's a trade," Draven corrected calmly. "Two options, both freely offered. She chooses which price she's willing to pay. The Law will recognize either one." He looked at Mira. "So what will it be, girl? Your freedom and your brother, in exchange for betraying Cassian again? Or your enslavement, in exchange for protecting him?"

Through their connection, Cassian felt Mira's mind racing. The temptation was enormous—Option A gave her everything she'd ever wanted. Everything she'd already betrayed Cassian for once before.

But beneath that temptation, he felt something else. Shame. Guilt. The memory of the safe house. The look on his face when he'd realized what she'd done.

"Mira," Cassian said urgently. "Take the first deal. I'll find a way to protect myself. I'll—"

"Stop," Draven said quietly, and simultaneously Cassian felt pressure building in Mira's chest. The Coin of Waters, manipulating the fluid in her lungs. Blood began to trickle from her nose again. "She decides. Not you. And she decides now, or I decide for her—and my decision ends with her drowning on dry land."

Mira gasped, clutching the bars. Her eyes met Cassian's through the cell entrance.

"I'm sorry," she whispered. Then, louder, to Draven: "The second one. I choose the second offer."

"No!" Cassian lunged forward, but the Hollow guards moved to block him. "Mira, don't do this. Your brother needs you—"

"My brother needs me to be better than I was," Mira said, tears streaming down her face. Blood still dripped from her nose, but her voice was steady. "I betrayed you once for him. I won't do it again. Not for anything."

She stepped forward out of the cell, but instead of moving toward Cassian, she turned to face Draven. "I, Mira of Millhaven, freely submit myself to your authority. I will serve as you command, bound by the Coin of Oxen's power, until you and Cassian reach an understanding. I will not resist. I will not flee. I give this oath witnessed by the Law." She swallowed hard. "In exchange, you will not tamper with my connection to Cassian's coin. You will let him leave here unharmed."

The air shifted. Cassian felt it through every fiber of his being—the Law responding to the proposed trade. The coins pulsed. His Coin of Heads burned hot against his chest. Draven's locket gleamed.

"No," Cassian said desperately. "Mira, you can't bind yourself like this. It's slavery. You'll never be free—we'll never reach an understanding, he and I. This is forever."

"Maybe," Mira said, looking at him. Through their connection, he felt her resolve—absolute, unshakable. But also her fear. Her regret. Her desperate hope that this would somehow be worth it. "But that's my choice to make. Not yours. Not his. Mine."

Draven was smiling now—not with cruelty, but with something almost like approval. "Clever girl. You've learned to think strategically. Very well. I accept your oath. You are bound to my authority until Cassian and I come to terms—which may indeed be never. In exchange, your connection to his coin remains yours, and he leaves here unharmed tonight. The Law witnesses this trade."

Both coins flared with light—the Coin of Oxen in Draven's locket burning brightest. And through their connection, Cassian felt something settle over Mira like a yoke—invisible but undeniable. The weight of authority. The binding of a willing oath.

She gasped, her knees buckling slightly. The Hollow guards caught her, but they weren't restraining her anymore. They were supporting her. Because she was one of them now—bound to Draven's will.

"Mira!" Cassian tried to push past the guards blocking him, but Draven raised a hand.

"The trade is complete," Draven said calmly. "She made her choice freely. The Law has witnessed and accepted it. Any attempt to break this bond now would violate the terms she agreed to. I'd strongly advise against it."

Through their mental connection, Cassian felt Mira's message, fierce despite her fear: *Go. This buys you time. Be smarter than your father. Find a way to stop him. Don't waste this.*

"But—" Cassian's voice broke.

"She gave up everything for you," Draven observed. "Her freedom. Her brother's restoration. Her future. All to keep me from accessing your coin." He tilted his head. "You should feel honored. Few people inspire that kind of loyalty."

He gestured to the guards holding Mira. "Take her to the east wing. Give her a proper room—she's not a prisoner anymore. She's a servant who made a contract. Treat her accordingly."

Then, to Cassian: "You should go now. Our business here is concluded. The mill, tomorrow at sunset. Come alone. Bring both coins. We'll discuss the future—and perhaps find a way to release her from her oath. Though I suspect you'll find my terms... challenging."

Cassian looked at Mira one last time. She was standing now, supported by the Hollow guards, blood still on her lips. Through their connection, he sent everything he couldn't say aloud: *I'll fix this. I'll find a way. I won't let this be permanent.*

And back from her: *I know. Just don't let it be for nothing. Stop him.*

Then Draven's presence pressed against the connection, not severing it but muting it. Cassian could still sense Mira was alive—a faint warmth somewhere behind him—but the details faded. Emotions, thoughts, location, all muted to almost nothing.

"A courtesy," Draven said. "So you won't be distracted by constant worry. You'll feel if she's in genuine danger, but otherwise... consider it my gift. So you can think clearly about tomorrow's conversation."

He smiled. "Until sunset, Cassian. I look forward to discovering whether you inherited your father's wisdom or merely his stubborn principles."

As Cassian climbed the stairs, each step felt heavier than the last. His father's face flashed through his mind—not as he'd been at the end, but as Cassian remembered him from childhood. Strong. Principled. Willing to fight for what was right.

And broken because of it. Dead from injuries Draven had inflicted.

*Don't fight him head-on,* Mira had sent. She was right. Draven had destroyed his father in single combat. Had two coins to Cassian's two, but years more experience. Had a network of Hollow to bear the cost of his power.

A direct fight would end the same way his father's had.

Which meant Cassian needed to be smarter. Needed to find another path.

The research. Whatever his father had sealed away in the royal archives. That was the key.

Cassian emerged into the night air—cooler now, the city settling into darkness.

He sent one last thought along the thread to Mira: *I'll find a way. I promise.*

No response. Just that faint warmth confirming her existence—Draven had muted the connection as promised.

Cassian pulled his coat tighter and headed back toward the palace.

He made it three blocks before the weight of everything crashed down on him. Cassian stumbled into an alley, pressing his back against the cold stone wall as his legs threatened to give out.

*My father. Draven broke him. Left him to crawl home and die.*

Three months. Three months of grief over what he'd been told was a tragic accident. A carriage wheel breaking at the wrong moment, a fall, injuries that couldn't be healed.

But it had been Draven. A deliberate confrontation. His father had discovered the coin collection, challenged Draven to stop, and been destroyed for it.

*And now Mira has bound herself. Enslaved herself to save me.*

The choice Draven had offered her replayed in his mind. Option A: Betray Cassian, give up the connection to his coin, and walk free with Torin fully restored. Everything she'd ever wanted. Everything she'd already betrayed him for once before.

Option B: Bind herself to Draven's authority—become his servant, unable to resist or flee—and protect Cassian's coin. Give up her freedom, her brother's restoration, her future.

She'd chosen Option B. Without hesitation.

The weight of that choice crushed him. She could have had everything she wanted. Instead, she'd chosen slavery to protect him. To prove she wouldn't make the same mistake twice.

The coins burned against his chest. The Coin of Heads pulsed with awareness, sensing his rage and grief. The Coin of Seeds hummed with potential, offering growth, transformation, change.

But what good were they? Draven had matched his collection and exceeded his experience. The Coin of Oxen granted inhuman strength—and now had Mira bound under its authority. The Coin of Waters could kill through any liquid connection. And his network of Hollow meant he never paid the true cost of using them.

*I can't beat him,* Cassian thought. *Not in a straight fight. Not the way my father tried.*

But he couldn't walk away either. Not with Mira bound by oath to serve Draven. Not with Perin, Elena, and the others still under threat. Not with a madman collecting the pieces of a crown that could reshape reality itself.

He took a shuddering breath, forcing himself to think. To plan.

What had Mira bought him with her sacrifice? Time. Clarity. Draven couldn't access the Coin of Heads through their connection now. And he'd promised not to move on the city before tomorrow's meeting.

She'd given up everything—her freedom, Torin's restoration, her future—to give Cassian a chance to find another way.

He couldn't waste it.

Tomorrow at sunset, he'd meet Draven at the mill. Not to negotiate in good faith—Draven had destroyed his father, and now enslaved Mira. But to buy more time. To learn. To position himself for whatever came next.

And somehow, he needed to find a way to free Mira from her oath without sacrificing the kingdom.

Cassian pushed off from the wall and continued toward the palace. His body felt heavy, exhausted from the emotional toll, but his mind was beginning to sharpen.

One day to find answers.

One day to become smarter than his father had been.

One day to find a way to free Mira and stop Draven both.

Cassian touched the coins through his shirt and made a silent promise—not just to Mira, but to his father's memory, to everyone Draven had broken:

*I'll stop you, Draven. And I'll free her. I don't know how yet. But I will.*

In that last moment before Draven had dampened their connection, Cassian had felt something through the bond. Not just Mira's resolve, but a memory she'd glimpsed. What Draven had shown her earlier—the crown. The vision of a world without suffering, without scarcity.

And even as she'd rejected the temptation to betray him, even as she'd chosen binding over betrayal, he'd felt something beneath her choice. Not regret, but recognition.

Draven's vision wasn't just manipulation. Part of it was genuine. A world where no one had to trade their humanity for survival. Where the Law of Balance served everyone equally.

*That's the real trap,* Cassian realized. Not just the violence or the threats or even the forced choices. The ideological trap: making people believe that surrendering freedom was an acceptable price for peace. That one man's vision, imposed through power, was better than the messy struggle of free people choosing their own paths.

His father had fought against that with conviction and principle. And been broken for it.

Mira had fought it with sacrifice. And been enslaved for it.

Cassian would need to be different. Smarter. More strategic.

He would need to fight not just with power, but with understanding. Not just to defeat Draven, but to prove there was another way.

And he had one day to learn how.
