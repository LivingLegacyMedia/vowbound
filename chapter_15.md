# Chapter 15: The Unhollow

The recruitment center squatted in Merchant's Row like a tumor—a converted warehouse with clean walls and welcoming lanterns. Twenty paces from the nearest building. Guards at every entrance. Too many exits to watch.

Cassian studied it from across the street, memorizing the patterns. Guards changed every two hours. New converts shuffled in through the south entrance around sunset, led by hollow-eyed handlers. The truly desperate entered through the front door in twos and threes, emerging an hour later with contracts clutched in trembling hands.

"Thirty-four people went in today," Mira whispered beside him. "Twenty-eight signed."

"How many are inside now?"

Cassian closed his eyes, reaching out with the Coin of Heads. Through the gray space, he could sense the hollow shimmer of minds inside the warehouse. Fresh tethers, recently bound. "Twenty-seven. All newly converted—the oldest can't be more than two days hollow."

"Twenty-seven," Mira repeated. "Handlers rotate them through in waves—sign, process, hold them for initial integration before moving them to the camps." She pulled her cloak tighter against the evening chill. "If we're doing this, now's the time. Before they move tonight's batch."

Cassian felt the weight of both coins in his pockets. The Coin of Heads pulsed with familiar warmth. The Coin of Seeds hummed with potential energy, eager to grow, to transform, to nurture.

Torin approached from the shadows, moving with the careful precision of someone still learning to trust their own body. "The eastern approach is clear. I convinced the merchant to leave his loading dock unlocked." A pause. "I didn't use the coin. Just... talked to him. Explained we were trying to help people."

"And he believed you?"

"He has a daughter. She almost signed a contract last week." Torin's expression remained flat, but something flickered in his eyes. "He wants to believe someone can stop them."

Perin arrived last, Elena's hand clasped in his. The girl looked pale but determined. "She insisted on coming," Perin said quietly. "Promised she'd stay hidden in the grain merchant's cellar. But she wanted to see... wanted to know this was real."

Elena looked up at Cassian with eyes too old for eight years. "You're really going to save them? Like you saved Papa?"

"I'm going to try."

"Papa says trying is better than doing nothing." She squeezed her father's hand. "Be careful."

---

The plan was simple in theory, catastrophic if it failed.

Cassian would enter through the eastern loading dock while the guards changed shifts. Mira and Perin would create a distraction at the front—nothing violent, just enough chaos to draw attention. Torin would wait outside the south exit, ready to help anyone who fled in panic.

Inside, Cassian would find the main holding area where fresh converts waited. He'd use the Coin of Heads to sever the tethers connecting them to Draven's network—not one at a time, but simultaneously, cutting through the connections like a scythe through wheat. Then, before the shock of disconnection killed them, he'd flood the space with growth energy from the Coin of Seeds. Not forcing restoration, but creating the conditions for natural healing. Letting them remember themselves.

The theory was sound. Torin had helped develop it through careful analysis of his own fragmented restoration. "You're not carrying their weight," he'd explained. "You're just providing the framework. The seed-bed. They do the growing themselves."

But theory and practice were different things.

Cassian slipped through the loading dock while angry voices erupted at the front entrance. Mira was shouting something about unfair contracts. Perin backed her up with indignant merchant's rhetoric. The guards moved toward the commotion.

Inside, the warehouse was divided into sections by canvas partitions. Cassian moved through the shadows, using the Coin of Heads to perceive the structure of the place. He saw value concentrated in the northern corner—not monetary worth, but the weight of stolen humanity. Twenty-seven souls recently hollowed, their essence flowing through invisible tethers to something vast and distant.

The holding area was a large room lined with cots. Men and women sat in perfect stillness, hands folded, eyes empty. A single handler stood watch—himself hollow, three years deep, barely human anymore.

Cassian entered quietly, but the handler turned immediately. "You shouldn't be here."

"I know." Cassian pulled out both coins. They blazed with heat in his palms. "Neither should they."

The handler reached for an alarm bell, but Cassian was faster. He entered his gray space—the Silent Market where value became visible—and pulled hard on the handler's tether. The connection snapped like rotted rope. The man staggered, confusion flooding his empty eyes. "I... what was I...?"

"Sit down," Cassian said gently. "You're about to remember everything. I'm sorry."

He didn't wait for a response. Twenty-seven tethers stretched from twenty-seven chests, all connecting to the same distant point. Cassian reached into the gray space and grasped them—not individually, but as a bundle. The threads were slick and cold, pulsing with stolen vitality.

This was it. The moment where theory met practice.

First, he had to try the fraud argument. Give them the chance at full restoration like Perin.

Cassian spoke to the Law, his voice clear despite the strain: "I'm taking their place temporarily. Holding their tethers while they petition for release. Same as before—my burden for theirs, limited duration."

The Law considered. It was a fair offer. One consciousness holding multiple connections, all temporary.

It accepted.

The tethers shifted from the twenty-seven converts to Cassian.

Emptiness flooded in like a dam breaking. Not one person's hollowness but twenty-seven at once. The pull of the network wrapped around his essence from every direction, trying to drain him, to make him hollow. His emotions began to flatten. His thoughts scattered. The void where their identities had been pressed against his mind like ice water.

*Hold on,* he told himself desperately. *Just hold on.*

In the real world, the converts gasped as their tethers released. For the first time in days or weeks, the constant draining stopped. They were free.

But not all of them moved. Five remained sitting perfectly still, faces blank. They'd tasted freedom and rejected it immediately. The emptiness was easier. Safer. They sank back into hollow stillness, choosing nothing over the pain of being whole.

Cassian felt a stab of grief, but he couldn't force them. Freedom had to be chosen.

"Listen!" he called to the remaining twenty-two. "You signed contracts with Draven Kane. He promised you peace but gave you emptiness. That's fraud. The Law recognizes fraud. Tell it—demand your humanity back because the terms were false!"

The twenty-two converts stared at him, confused and disoriented by sudden freedom. Some turned and fled immediately—three ran for the exits in blind panic, disappearing before Cassian could stop them.

That left nineteen.

"Say it!" Cassian commanded, feeling the hollowness seeping deeper into his mind. "The contract was false. You demand restoration. Say it now!"

A few understood. A woman near the front spoke haltingly: "The contract... it was false. I was promised peace. I got nothing. I want... I want my love back. My son. Everything taken."

Others echoed her, their voices gaining strength. Demanding restoration. Claiming the contracts were fraudulent.

Cassian felt the Law evaluating each petition. Weighing the claims. Checking the contract terms.

And one by one, the Law rejected most of them.

The contracts weren't technically fraudulent. "Peace" versus "emptiness" was interpretation, not deception. The terms had been vague, yes, but not false. Draven had been too careful. Too precise in his wording.

Eight people—only eight out of nineteen—had their petitions accepted. They'd been promised specific things in their contracts that Draven had explicitly failed to deliver. Their humanity began returning from the reservoir, and Cassian quickly used the Coin of Seeds to broker trades for safe restoration, offering his own vitality to make the returns gentle rather than violent.

But the other eleven? The Law ruled their contracts valid, if vague.

Which meant their humanity wouldn't be returned. They were free from the tethers, but still hollow. Still damaged.

*Just like Torin,* Cassian realized. *This is what I expected. What I planned for.*

He couldn't hold the tethers much longer. The emptiness was overwhelming him, fragmenting his thoughts. Soon he wouldn't remember why he was holding on.

"It's all right," he called out to the eleven whose petitions failed. "I'm breaking the tethers anyway. You won't get everything back, but you'll be free. Better than staying hollow. Trust me!"

Then he released them all at once.

The tethers snapped back toward their original owners, but found nothing to attach to. The converts were disconnected now, severed from the network. The tethers dissolved like smoke, dissipating into nothing.

Gone.

Cassian collapsed back into his own mind, gasping. The eight fully restored converts were weeping—pain and joy mixing as their complete humanity integrated. The other eleven looked confused, disoriented, damaged. Like Torin had been.

They were free, but they weren't whole.

Fragments of memory remained. Partial feeling. But the connections were broken. The neural pathways severed. They'd been hollow long enough for some damage to be permanent—or at least, would require months of patient rebuilding.

*Better than staying hollow,* Cassian told himself. *They can rebuild. We'll help them.*

But the cost to himself was severe. Holding twenty-seven tethers simultaneously had shattered his coherence. Making three separate restoration trades had drained his vitality. His thoughts felt like puzzle pieces dumped from a box. His memories surfaced randomly, disconnected from meaning.

Around the room, chaos erupted.

The eight fully restored converts were screaming—overwhelmed by the sudden return of everything they'd lost. The eleven partially freed ones stumbled around in confusion, trying to understand what they should be feeling. Some wept. Some laughed inappropriately. Some just stood there, blank-faced, no better off than before.

The handler Cassian had freed first sat in the corner, rocking back and forth. "Three years," he whispered. "Three years I've been nothing."

Then the alarm bells started ringing.

---

Mira burst through the eastern entrance. "We need to go! Now! More guards coming from the north barracks—at least fifty!"

Cassian couldn't respond. He was locked in the gray space, maintaining the growth energy, watching neural pathways reconnect in twenty-seven minds. If he stopped now, some would revert. Some would fragment beyond repair. Some would—

"Cassian!" Mira grabbed his shoulder, shaking him. "They'll kill us all if we stay!"

Torin appeared at the south exit, supporting two of the newly freed converts who could barely walk. "I can take four at most. The others need more time."

Perin rushed in behind him, his carpenter's hands steady despite the chaos. "The guards are coming through the front. We have maybe two minutes."

Cassian heard boots pounding in the distance. Shouts. The metallic ring of drawn swords.

He was still split between worlds—half maintaining the restoration in the gray space, half aware of physical danger closing in. The converts weren't stable yet. Five more minutes and most of them would integrate properly. But five minutes might as well be five hours.

"Cassian!" Mira's voice cut through his divided awareness. "Choose now or we all die here!"

The first guards burst through the front entrance.

Cassian felt his awareness splitting—half in the gray space maintaining the restoration, half in the physical world where danger closed in. The coins burned in his hands. The newly freed were still fragile, still uncertain, still teetering between wholeness and collapse.

But Mira was right. They had to go.

With enormous effort, Cassian released the growth energy all at once—a final surge of potential scattered across twenty-seven souls. Some would use it to fully restore themselves. Others might not have enough yet. But it was all he could give.

He stumbled back into full awareness as guards crashed through the canvas partitions.

"Out!" he managed. "Everyone out now!"

Torin was already moving, pulling converts toward the south exit. Perin grabbed two who were frozen in shock and physically dragged them. Mira positioned herself between Cassian and the advancing guards, a stolen baton in her hands.

"Go!" she shouted at the converts. "South exit! Run!"

The newly freed fled in chaos—some running with desperate purpose, others stumbling like sleepwalkers. Three bolted in completely random directions, driven by panic rather than reason, and disappeared into the warehouse maze before anyone could stop them.

The handler tried to help. He grabbed a weeping woman who'd frozen in terror and pushed her toward the exit. "Go! Run!" His voice was raw, emotions flooding back after years of nothing.

Then guards poured through the front entrance like a breaking dam.

"Here!" one shouted, spotting the handler. "This one's ours!"

Two guards seized him. The handler fought back—clumsy, unpracticed, three years of muscle memory lost—but he fought. "Get out!" he screamed at the fleeing converts. "All of you, run!"

A guard's club struck his temple. He crumpled, blood streaming down his face.

Cassian tried to turn back, but Mira grabbed his arm and yanked him toward the south exit. "You can't save everyone! Move!"

More guards crashed through the north entrance, cutting off stragglers. A young man who'd been fully restored—one of the eight whose petitions the Law had accepted—tripped over an overturned cot. Guards were on him in seconds. He screamed as they bound his wrists, the sound raw and human and terrified.

An older woman stood frozen in the doorway, torn between running and helping those who'd fallen behind. A guard tackled her, driving her to the ground. Her head cracked against the stone floor and she went limp.

"Keep moving!" Torin shouted from the south exit, still pulling converts through. "Don't look back!"

Cassian reached the exit with Mira half-dragging him, his legs barely functional. He turned for one last look.

The warehouse was carnage. Overturned cots. People screaming or weeping or lying still. Five converts sat in perfect hollow stillness, having rejected freedom the moment it was offered. Guards swarmed through every entrance, binding wrists, clubbing anyone who resisted.

The handler was on his knees, blood streaming from his temple, hands being bound behind his back. But his eyes were alive—terrified and furious and aware.

Eight people captured. Maybe more already dead in the chaos.

Then guards spotted Cassian at the exit and charged.

Mira shoved him through the doorway. They ran into the narrow alley behind the warehouse, following Torin and the survivors. Boots thundered behind them.

"Split up!" Torin called back. "Anyone who can, run!"

The group scattered. Cassian stumbled after Mira, his thoughts still disjointed from holding the tethers. His legs felt like water. The coins in his pockets burned hot. Everything was fragmenting—his vision, his thoughts, his sense of direction.

They turned a corner. Then another. Mira was shouting something but the words wouldn't form meaning. More guards ahead. Blocking the street.

Cassian tried to reach for the Coin of Heads, to perceive a way out, but his mind was too scattered. Holding twenty-seven tethers simultaneously had shattered something inside him. He couldn't focus. Couldn't think.

"This way!" Mira dragged him into a side alley.

Dead end.

They turned back. Guards filled the entrance, advancing with drawn clubs. No way out. No escape.

Cassian fumbled for the coins, trying to make a trade, trying to negotiate, but the guards were on them before he could form coherent thought.

A club struck his shoulder. He went down hard, the coins spilling from his grip and clattering across cobblestones. Mira fought—he heard her screaming, hitting someone—but there were too many.

Hands seized him. Rough voices. His wrists yanked behind his back and bound with rope that bit into skin. Someone grabbed the coins from where they'd fallen.

"Got him!" a guard shouted. "And the other one!"

Cassian tried to protest, to explain, but his thoughts were scattered puzzle pieces that wouldn't fit together. The world spun. He was being dragged. Mira was beside him, also bound, blood running from her nose.

More guards arrived. And with them—

Cassian's stomach dropped.

Perin. Hands bound. Blood matted in his hair. And Torin, moving with mechanical compliance, eyes distant. Both captured.

"All four," the lead guard reported to someone out of sight. "And we've secured both artifacts."

A woman's voice, cold and precise: "Excellent. Take them to the holding facility. Draven will want to question them personally before deciding what to do with them."

No.

Cassian tried to fight, but his body wouldn't obey. Too exhausted. Too fragmented. Too broken from the restoration attempt.

They were being loaded into a cart. Metal bars. A cage on wheels.

The last thing Cassian saw before darkness took him was Merchant's Row receding into the distance, and the handful of freed converts scattering into alleys and shadows—some stumbling with partial restoration, some weeping with returned emotions, all of them fleeing while the Unhollow was dragged away in chains.

They'd freed eleven people.

And lost everything.

---

In his command tent miles to the north, Draven Kane listened to the report with growing satisfaction.

"All four captured," his emissary reported, standing at attention. "Cassian, Mira, the carpenter Perin, and the partially restored one called Torin. They're being held at the warehouse facility, awaiting your orders."

"And the coins?"

"Both secured. We found them in Cassian's possession—the Coin of Heads and the Coin of Seeds."

Draven smiled. "Excellent. And the converts he attempted to free?"

"Eleven escaped in the confusion. Five were fully restored through the fraud argument, six partially severed but damaged. Eight were recaptured immediately, three died in the escape, five chose to remain hollow even when their tethers were released, and three fled in panic before we could secure them."

"So from twenty-seven converts, he managed to save eleven." Draven touched the golden locket at his throat, feeling the Coin of Oxen pulse with stolen strength. "Not bad for an amateur. But ultimately futile."

"The method worked as you predicted. He held all the tethers, using the Coin of Heads to temporarily take their place in the network. Then he used the Coin of Seeds to help them petition the Law through the fraud argument. The mental strain on him was enormous—he was barely conscious by the time our reinforcements arrived."

"Perfect." Draven stood, moving to his maps. "So he can free perhaps two dozen people at once, but it fragments his mind so badly he can't defend himself afterward. The fraud argument works for a small percentage, but most end up only partially restored. And most importantly—he's willing to sacrifice everything, including his own freedom, to save even a handful of people."

"That makes him predictable."

"That makes him exploitable." Draven gestured to the map of Arvenstead. "Send word to our contacts in the King's council. I want this framed correctly—not as enemy soldiers capturing the King's agent, but as legitimate business owners defending their property from an armed raid."

"The Merchant's Relief Society was within its rights to detain trespassers?"

"Exactly. Cassian and his accomplices broke into a registered charity, assaulted staff, and attempted to kidnap clients against their will. We have witnesses. We have property damage. We have legal standing." Draven's smile widened. "Let the King try to rescue his 'official agent' now. If he does, he admits the crown sanctioned an illegal raid on a legitimate business. If he doesn't, Cassian learns the cost of operating without political cover."

"And if Cassian escapes?"

"He won't. Not with both coins in our possession and his mind still fragmented." Draven returned to his desk. "But if he somehow manages it, that's fine too. Every escape attempt will teach us more about his capabilities. Every rescue will cost him pieces of himself. Eventually, he'll have given up so much that there won't be enough of him left to save anyone."

The emissary nodded. "And the eleven he freed?"

"Let them scatter. They're damaged goods—five with full emotions they can't manage, six with partial consciousness that will take months to repair. They'll spread word about what happened here, and people will learn: resisting the Hollow means capture, torture, and watching your rescuer dragged away in chains." Draven opened the locket briefly, letting the Coin of Oxen's light fill the tent. "Fear is more effective than force. Let the city see what happens to those who fight us."

"Should we interrogate the prisoners?"

"Not yet. Let them sit in those cells for a few days. Let them wonder if the King will come. Let them realize how thoroughly they've been abandoned." Draven closed the locket. "Then we'll see what pieces of information we can extract before deciding what to do with them."

"And if the King does try a rescue?"

"Then we'll see just how much political capital he's willing to spend on four criminals who broke into a registered charity and assaulted its workers." Draven's smile was cold. "Either way, we win. Either Cassian learns he can't operate in Arvenstead, or the King reveals how weak his position truly is."

The emissary bowed and withdrew.

Alone, Draven studied the two coins lying on his desk—the Coin of Heads with its symbols of wisdom and perception, the Coin of Seeds with its promise of growth and restoration. Three crown jewels now within his reach.

And Cassian, the self-righteous idealist who thought he could save the world one person at a time, sitting in a cell learning what happens when his reckless ideas meet reality.

Perfect.

---

In the royal palace, King Aldric read the report three times before finally setting it down.

"He was captured?"

"Along with three accomplices," his chancellor confirmed grimly. "The Merchant's Relief Society claims they were defending against an armed raid. They have witnesses prepared to testify that Cassian and his group broke in, assaulted staff, and attempted to abduct clients by force."

"Clients." The King's voice was flat. "They mean hollow converts."

"The law doesn't recognize that distinction, Your Majesty. Officially, the Relief Society is a registered charity providing debt consolidation services. What Cassian did—legally speaking—was commit assault and attempted kidnapping."

The King closed his eyes. "And if I send forces to retrieve him?"

"You'd be admitting the crown sanctioned an illegal raid on a legitimate business. The merchant's guild would revolt. Half your council would call it tyranny. And you'd give the Society legal grounds to claim you're persecuting their organizations without cause."

"And if I don't?"

"Then your official agent—the man you publicly endorsed as the Covenant's champion—sits in Draven's cells while you do nothing. It makes you look weak. Or complicit."

The King stood, pacing to the window. Below, the city spread out in evening light. Somewhere in those streets, Cassian sat in chains. Somewhere, eleven freed converts scattered and hid, terrified of being recaptured. Somewhere, Draven Kane smiled at how perfectly his trap had worked.

"I told him I couldn't officially sanction an unauthorized operation," the King said quietly. "I thought he understood—I was giving him permission to act while maintaining my deniability. I didn't think he'd actually get caught."

"He's exhausted, Your Majesty. The reports say he was barely conscious when they captured him. Whatever he did in that warehouse, it cost him everything he had."

"And now he pays for it." The King's hands clenched. "How long do we have?"

"The Relief Society is filing formal charges tomorrow morning. If we're going to act, it has to be tonight."

The King was quiet for a long moment, weighing his options. Save Cassian and risk political catastrophe. Abandon him and lose the only person who'd actually made progress against the Hollow.

"Summon the council," he said finally. "All of them. Emergency session. Now."

"What will you tell them?"

"The truth." The King turned from the window, his expression hard. "That we have a chance to rescue someone who's actually fighting for this kingdom. And if we don't take it, we deserve exactly what Draven has planned for us."

The chancellor bowed and withdrew, leaving the King alone with his impossible choice.

Outside, night fell over Arvenstead.

And in a warehouse cell, Cassian slowly regained consciousness, finding himself bound, weaponless, and surrounded by enemies who now held both coins.

The Unhollow's first operation was over.

And they'd lost.
