# Chapter 8: The Market of the Mind

The walls had held.

Cassian stood on the eastern ramparts as dawn broke gray and cold over Arvenstead. Below, the battlefield was a churned mess of mud and blood. Bodies—Hollow soldiers who'd thrown themselves at the defenses with mechanical precision—littered the ground. But the walls stood. The city survived.

The attack had come early. Not tomorrow night as Corvan's intelligence had suggested, but last night. A coordinated assault from multiple directions while the defenders were still preparing. But Cassian's strategy had worked—the drums, the horns, the constant noise that robbed the Hollow of their psychological weapons. What should have been a devastating siege had become ordinary warfare.

And ordinary warfare, the Hollow lost.

But the victory felt hollow. Seventeen dead. Dozens more wounded. And somewhere in the city, Draven Kane had been close enough that Cassian's coin had pulsed with recognition. Close enough to strike at the capital itself.

The memory extraction still haunted him. Lord Corvan's children, pulled from his mind like roots from soil. The man's empty confusion afterward. *I have children?* Asked without emotion, without connection. A father made stranger to his own family.

*I did that,* Cassian thought. *I made that trade.*

"You look worse than yesterday."

Cassian turned. Mira stood a few paces behind him, travel-worn and weary. Her dark hair was tied back, and there were fresh bruises on her knuckles—she'd been fighting on the walls during the night assault.

"So do you," he said. "Did you get any sleep?"

"Two hours. Maybe." She moved to stand beside him, looking out over the battlefield. "The King's advisors are calling you a hero. Your noise strategy saved the city."

"And got seventeen people killed because the intelligence was wrong."

"The intelligence got three thousand Hollow killed and kept this city from falling." She paused, studying his face. "I know that look. My brother wore it for months before..." She stopped, turned back to the battlefield. "Don't."

He wanted to ask what she meant. But he already knew.

"Are we still going?" Mira asked quietly. "North to the camps? Or has last night changed things?"

Cassian had been wondering the same thing. The King would want him to stay. Lord Herrick would argue he was too valuable to risk. Every rational voice said to remain in the capital.

But the foreign memories still whispered in his mind—thin, damaged, possibly fabricated. If Corvan's intelligence had been corrupted, more people would die on false information.

"We're going," he said. "If the newly converted were supposed to be part of last night's assault and weren't, they're either still at the northern camp or being moved."

"And Torin?"

"And Torin," Cassian agreed. "My father's journal mentioned that transitions take four to six weeks to complete. Three weeks means there might still be fragments of who he was. Still something to reach."

Relief crossed her face for a moment. "When do we leave?"

"Now. Before the King's advisors wake up and decide I'm more useful locked in the palace." He started toward the stairs. "Did you get the horses?"

"Waiting at the north postern gate. Supplies for three days." She fell into step beside him. "I also grabbed your father's journal from the common room at the Broken Wheel this morning—you'd left it on the table. Thought you might want it."

He glanced at her, surprised. "You went to the Broken Wheel?"

"I've been planning this since yesterday. When I make contingency plans, I make them thorough." A slight smile. "Besides, if we're walking into a Hollow camp, I want you to have every advantage. Including whatever your father learned about these artifacts."

They navigated the palace corridors quickly, avoiding the main halls where nobles and military commanders would be gathering for the morning briefing. Within minutes they were through the postern gate and mounting the horses Mira had prepared.

"Ready?" she asked.

Cassian looked north, toward the aqueduct ruins hidden beyond the hills. Toward three thousand Hollow and whatever trap Draven had prepared. Toward a quest to save one young man who'd traded away his humanity for peace.

The coin pulsed warm against his chest.

"No," he said honestly. "But we're going anyway."

---

They rode north through gray morning mist, two figures on horseback following a road that led away from safety and toward everything Cassian knew he should avoid.

Mira rode in focused silence, her attention fixed on the horizon. On her brother. On whatever remained of him in that distant camp. She'd barely spoken since they'd left Arvenstead, lost in her own thoughts.

Cassian used the quiet to experiment.

He held the coin loosely in his palm, feeling its warmth spread through his hand. Then he closed his eyes and let his awareness expand—not looking at the physical world, but at the layer beneath it. The shimmer. The weight of value and meaning that clung to everything.

At first, it was overwhelming. Too much information flooding his senses at once. The trees alongside the road carried years of growth, seasons of survival. The stones beneath their horses' hooves held the weight of countless travelers. Even the wind carried value—movement, change, the bringing of weather from distant places.

But as he focused, as he learned to filter the noise, patterns emerged.

Everything was connected. Value flowed between things like water seeking its level. A tree drew from soil and sun, gave shelter to birds and shade to travelers. The birds ate insects, fed their young, became food for predators. The predators died and enriched the soil. Round and round in endless cycles of exchange.

*The Law of Balance,* Cassian thought. *Not just a rule about trades. A glimpse into how reality works.*

He pushed deeper, trying to understand the invisible architecture. And as he did, something shifted in his perception.

The gray mist around them became *visible*—not with his eyes, but with that other sense. It wasn't actual mist, but something else. A place that existed between perception and reality. A space where the patterns of value became more than abstract impressions.

He could almost *step* into it. Almost reach that place where exchanges happened at a fundamental level.

*The Market of the Mind,* his father's journal had called it. *The space where trades are made not with hands but with will. Where nature itself can be negotiated.*

Cassian pulled back, gasping. The physical world snapped back into focus—trees, road, mist. His heart was hammering.

"Cassian?" Mira had stopped her horse, concern on her face. "Are you all right?"

"I think so." He steadied his breathing. "I was trying to better understand... And I found..." He struggled for words. "There's a place I can reach. Not physical, but real. Where the coin's power is strongest. Where I might be able to do more than just see value—where I might be able to reshape it."

"Can this place help you save Torin?"

"Maybe." He urged his horse forward. "But there's always a cost."

They rode in silence for a while. The sun climbed higher, burning away the mist, revealing rolling hills stretching north.

"Tell me about him," Cassian said. "About Torin. Before."

Mira glanced at him, surprised. "Why?"

"Because if I'm going to try to reach him, I need to understand what I'm trying to restore. Who he was. What mattered to him."

She was quiet for so long Cassian thought she might not answer. Then, quietly: "He was brilliant. Not just intelligent, but *brilliant*. Could see patterns others missed, solve problems that seemed impossible. Our father was a physician, and Torin inherited his mind for healing. He wanted to cure diseases, save lives, make the world better."

Her voice softened with memory. "When he was twelve, there was a plague in our district. Father was working himself to death trying to treat everyone. Torin stayed up three nights straight, reading every medical text he could find, trying to find the pattern. He figured out the disease was spreading through contaminated water from a particular well. Saved hundreds of lives just by thinking clearly when everyone else was panicking."

"Sounds like a good man."

"He was." Pain crept into her voice. "But that was also his weakness. He felt *everything*. Every person he couldn't save haunted him. Every child who died despite his best efforts carved another wound into his heart. After our mother got sick..." She stopped, composing herself. "He tried everything. Every remedy, every experimental treatment. Nothing worked. She died slowly, in pain, while he watched helplessly."

"And that broke him."

"Completely." Mira's hands tightened on her reins. "He stopped eating, stopped sleeping. Just sat in his room surrounded by medical texts, trying to figure out what he'd done wrong. What he'd missed. How he'd failed her. When the Hollow came to our city, offering to take away pain..." She shook her head. "I knew he'd accept. I begged him not to. But he looked at me with such desperate exhaustion and said, 'I can't carry this anymore, Mira. I'm drowning.' And then he opened that locket, and I watched my brother disappear."

Cassian's throat tightened. He'd watched his father disappear into obsession the same way. Seen the light go out, day by day.

"We'll find him," he said.

"Even if it means walking into Draven's trap?"

"Especially then." He met her eyes, and saw his own desperation reflected there.

She nodded once, understanding passing between them without words.

They rode on toward the aqueduct ruins. Toward the trap. Toward whatever waited in the space between hope and horror.

And in Cassian's pocket, the coin pulsed with steady warmth, as if counting down to something inevitable.

---

They stopped at midday in a village called Thornrest to rest the horses and gather supplies.

The village was small—barely more than a crossroads with an inn and a handful of farms. But something about it felt wrong. Too quiet. Too still. The few people Cassian saw moved with careful, measured steps, speaking in low voices, avoiding eye contact.

Fear hung over the place like smoke.

"Something's happened here," Mira said quietly as they tied their horses outside the inn.

Cassian nodded. He could feel it through the coin's perception—a wrongness in the atmosphere. As if the village itself had been wounded.

Inside, the inn was nearly empty despite the lunch hour. An old woman sat near the fireplace, staring at nothing. Two farmers occupied a corner table, speaking in urgent whispers. The innkeeper—a tired-looking woman with graying hair—looked up as they entered, and Cassian saw wariness flash across her face.

"We need food and water for two," Cassian said, placing coins on the counter. "And information, if you're willing to share it."

The innkeeper took the coins without counting them. "Food I can provide. Information..." She glanced toward the farmers, then back to Cassian. "What kind of information?"

"The northern road. The aqueduct ruins. Are there Hollow forces in the area?"

The woman's face went pale. "You don't want to go north."

"We have our reasons."

"Then you're fools." She pushed the coins back across the counter. "I won't take money from the dead. Eat if you want, but don't ask me to help you ride to your deaths."

Before Cassian could respond, one of the farmers stood and approached. He was middle-aged, with work-worn hands and a face carved by weather and grief.

"You're going north," the farmer said. Not a question.

Mira nodded.

The farmer looked at Cassian for a long moment. Something in his expression shifted—recognition, maybe. Or resignation. "How long?"

"Three weeks," Mira said quietly.

The man's jaw clenched. He glanced back at his companion, who was staring into his mug like it held answers. "Two weeks for us. My son."

Silence stretched. The innkeeper had stopped wiping the counter.

"I went up there." The farmer's voice was rough, unused. "Thought I could... I don't know what I thought. That he'd see me and remember. That love would be stronger than..." He stopped, swallowed. "They brought him out. Let me talk to him."

"And?" Cassian asked.

The farmer's hands opened and closed at his sides. "He was polite. Smiled. Asked if I needed directions back to the village." His voice went flat. "Didn't know me."

Mira's face had gone pale.

"The emissary said I could have him back. Trade myself instead. Draven's generous that way—equal exchange." The farmer's laugh was bitter. "My wife was there. She grabbed my arm so hard she left bruises. Our daughter's only eight."

He looked at Mira with something that wasn't quite pity. "I left my son in that camp. Rode away while he waved goodbye like I was a stranger he'd helped." He turned back to his table, then paused. "The Hollow don't give anything back for free. Whatever they tell you it costs, triple it."

The farmer sat down heavily. His companion put a hand on his shoulder, said nothing.

Cassian and Mira didn't speak for the rest of the meal.

Cassian and Mira exchanged glances. The warning was clear, and it matched what Corvan had said. This was a trap, and everyone knew it.

But knowing it was a trap didn't change what they had to do.

They ate in silence—thin stew and hard bread—while the village's fear pressed in around them. When they were ready to leave, the innkeeper finally spoke again.

"There's a ravine about two miles north. Leads up to the ridge overlooking the camps. You can see the whole valley from there without being seen yourself." She wouldn't meet Cassian's eyes. "If you're determined to die, at least see what you're facing first."

"Thank you," Cassian said.

As they mounted their horses, the farmer called out one last time. "Boy." Cassian turned. "If you do find a way to bring them back—if you somehow manage what no one else has—you come back here and you tell me. You understand? You tell me there's hope."

"I will," Cassian promised.

They rode north out of Thornrest, leaving behind a village haunted by what the Hollow had already taken.

---

The ravine appeared late in the afternoon, exactly where the innkeeper had described. A natural cut in the hillside that led up to a rocky ridge. They left the horses sheltered in the ravine and climbed on foot, moving carefully to avoid being seen.

At the top, they found an outcropping of stone that provided perfect cover while offering a clear view of the valley below.

And there it was. The aqueduct ruins.

Massive stone arches stretched across the dried riverbed, ancient and crumbling but still imposing. And surrounding them, spread across the valley in precise, geometric patterns, was the Hollow's camp.

Even from this distance, Cassian could see there were thousands. Rows of identical tents. Cookfires burning at regular intervals. Sentries posted at every approach. And everywhere, people moving with that same mechanical precision—no chaos, no shouting, no life. Just efficient, emotionless activity.

"God," Mira breathed beside him. "There are so many."

Cassian pulled the coin from his pocket and focused his perception on the camp. The shimmer appeared immediately—but it was wrong. Distorted. Instead of the normal glow of human value and meaning, the camp looked like a wound in reality. A place where value had been extracted, leaving only emptiness behind.

And at the center, in the largest tent near the ancient aqueducts, something else. A concentration of power that made his skin crawl. Not emptiness, but accumulation. A vast reservoir of stolen humanity, collected and held.

"Draven's there," Cassian said. "In the central tent. I can feel him."

"Can you sense Torin?"

Cassian tried to focus his perception more precisely, searching for fragments of recent conversions. Looking for someone three weeks into transition who might still have pieces of himself remaining.

There. In the western section of the camp, in three large tents set apart from the others. Multiple presences that felt... different. Still hollow, but not completely. Like echoes of people rather than absolute voids.

"I think so," he said. "Western tents. But Mira, there are hundreds in transition. I can't tell which one is your brother from here."

"Then we need to get closer."

"Wait." Cassian pulled her back down behind the rocks. "Look at the patrol patterns. The sentries. The way the camp is organized." He studied the layout, trying to see beyond the surface. "This whole place is designed to funnel intruders toward that central tent. Toward Draven. Any approach gets noticed, tracked, herded."

"So what do we do?"

Cassian was quiet for a long moment, turning the coin over in his hands. Thinking. Planning.

"We stop trying to be clever," he said finally. "We walk straight to the central tent and demand to negotiate."

"That's insane."

"It's unexpected. Draven's trap assumes I'll try to sneak in. Try to rescue your brother quietly. He's counting on me being clever, being cautious." Cassian met her eyes. "But what if I offer him something he wants more than whatever game he's playing? What if I make him a trade he actually has to consider?"

"What could you possibly offer that Draven wants?"

Cassian held up the coin. In the fading afternoon light, its surface seemed to absorb the shadows. "This. An artifact like his own. Another piece of Aram's Crown. That's what he's really after—not just converting people, but collecting power. If I can make him believe I might trade this..."

"He'll know you're lying."

"Will he?" Cassian stood, his mind racing through possibilities. "What if I'm not lying? What if I'm willing to trade this coin for something of equal value—like proof that conversions can be reversed. A demonstration. Using your brother."

Mira stared at him. "You'd give up your power?"

"I said I'd offer to. Whether he accepts, whether the trade actually completes..." Cassian pocketed the coin again. "That's where things get interesting. Because I've been learning something about how these exchanges work. They require consent from both parties. True consent, not coercion. And if I can get Draven to the negotiating table, actually talking terms..." He trailed off, thinking.

"Then what?"

"Then I find out if I'm as clever as I think I am." He started back down the ravine toward the horses. "Or I die learning how outmatched I really am. Either way, we'll have answers."

Mira followed, and Cassian could feel her eyes on his back. Questioning. Worried. Maybe regretting bringing him into this.

"There's something else I need to try," Cassian said as they reached the horses. "That deeper state. The Market. If I can reach it fully, I might be able to do more. But, I might..."

"You might not come back."

He nodded.

Mira mounted her horse. "Then don't go too deep unless you have to."

They rode slowly back toward the main road as sunset bled across the horizon. Tomorrow morning, they would approach the camp. Walk straight into whatever Draven had prepared.

Cassian thought of the farmer's son, waving goodbye to his father like a stranger. The village full of people who'd already given up.

His hand moved to the coin without thinking. It was warm. Always warm.

He wondered if that was reassuring or a warning.

The coin pulsed warm against his chest, as if sensing his fear.

And somewhere ahead, in that valley full of empty people, Draven Kane waited for the challenger who thought he could negotiate with a void.

---

They made camp that night in a small clearing off the road, hidden by a thick stand of trees.

No fire—too visible. They ate dried meat and hard bread in the gathering darkness, speaking little. The weight of tomorrow pressed on both of them, making conversation feel trivial.

Mira sat with her back against a tree, pulling out a small leather-bound sketchbook. Worn pages, edges softened by years of handling. She opened it carefully, revealing a charcoal sketch of a young man with dark hair and intense eyes.

"He looks like you," Cassian said quietly.

"Everyone said that." Mira's thumb brushed the drawing. She turned the page. Another sketch—the same man, younger, laughing. Then another—bent over books, teaching children. Page after page of moments captured in charcoal.

She stopped at one near the end. The same face, but hollow-eyed, surrounded by scattered papers. The lines were different here—heavier, more urgent. Like she'd been trying to press the memory into the page before it faded.

"After Mother died, I showed him these." Her voice was barely above a whisper. "Thought it would help. Remind him of..." She stopped, closed the sketchbook. "He looked at them for a long time. Then he said, 'I don't want to be that person anymore.'"

She stared at the closed book in her lap. "Two days later, he was gone."

"That's when he made his choice."

"For those two days, he was just in his room. Holding the locket."

Cassian waited.

"I begged him not to. He just kept turning it over in his hands. Over and over. And then he looked at me and..." Her voice broke. "His eyes were already empty. Like he'd left before he even opened it."

She closed her eyes. "When they took him, he hugged me. Thanked me for trying to help. So polite. Like I was someone who'd held a door open for him."

A tear tracked down her cheek. She wiped it away roughly. "I haven't seen him since."

Cassian felt the weight of her grief settle over him. "We'll find him tomorrow."

"Will we?" She looked at him with desperate hope. "What if there's nothing left?"

Cassian pulled out the coin, let it catch the firelight. "If value can be taken, it can be returned. Those are the rules."

"How can you be sure?"

"I can't." He wouldn't lie to her. "But it's what I have to believe."

Mira was silent for a long moment. Then, quietly: "Why are you really doing this?"

Cassian turned the coin over in his hands. His father's journal had pages about theoretical reversals. Equations. Failed experiments. The handwriting got shakier toward the end, more desperate.

"My father spent his life on maybes," he said finally. "Maybe these artifacts work. Maybe people can be saved. Maybe it all means something." He looked at the coin. "I'd like to prove one of his theories right."

Mira studied him in the darkness. "That's not the whole reason."

It wasn't. But the rest was too tangled to explain—guilt and grief and the weight of a power he hadn't earned. "No," he admitted. "But it's enough."

Mira studied him in the darkness. "This will probably kill you. You know that."

"I know."

"And you're doing it anyway."

He thought of his father's final journals. The shaking handwriting. The desperate hope that never quite died.

"I'm doing it anyway."

She reached out and squeezed his hand briefly. "Thank you. Whatever happens tomorrow, thank you for trying."

They settled into their bedrolls after that, but Cassian couldn't sleep. Tomorrow he would walk into a camp of three thousand Hollow and attempt to negotiate with a man who'd mastered the art of corrupted exchange.

One chance to save Torin. Prove conversions could be reversed.

Or join the thousands of empty souls below.

He pulled out the coin, let his eyes close. Tried to focus—not on planning, but on understanding. Reaching for that deeper perception.

Each time he used this power, this market-of-the-mind, he understood it better. Saw the patterns more clearly. The coin didn't give him answers—it showed him shards he had to assemble himself.

Now he let his awareness expand, trying to sense what waited in the camp below.

---

The world shifted.

Not physically, but in perception. Cassian found himself in gray space—experiencing it with some sense beyond sight. Abstract impressions of value floated like ash in still air.

He stood at a threshold. A place where the rules of exchange became visible.

He focused on what he needed: How to reach someone who'd traded away their humanity. How to restore what had been taken.

The impressions swirled. He saw the golden locket opening. Saw something being pulled out—not memories, but essence. The fundamental pattern that made a person themselves.

And he saw where it went. Not stored. Transferred. A vast reservoir of stolen humanity, growing with each conversion.

*Every Hollow is connected. Part of a network. Their humanity flows to the center.*

Which meant freeing one required severing that connection.

*Can I do that?*

Something stirred. The coin's presence, or something else. But awareness bloomed in his mind, wordless:

Yes. But the cost would be taking that connection into himself. Temporarily. Long enough to cut it. Which meant for those moments, Cassian would be part of the network. Would feel every hollow soul. Would touch Draven's reservoir.

Draven would know immediately.

*Minutes at most. Maybe seconds.*

The presence pulsed—warning and confirmation both. Then showed him one more thing:

Himself, after. Changed. Marked. One step closer to what he fought.

The gray space faded.

Cassian opened his eyes, gasping. The sun had set. Stars were appearing. Mira was shaking his shoulder.

"You were gone," she said. "Just sitting there, barely breathing—"

"I know how to try." His voice was rough. "But we'll have to move fast. He'll sense what I'm doing."

They gathered their gear in silence and began the descent. Into the valley. Into the camp. Into whatever waited.

Cassian carried the coin in one hand, its warmth almost painful now.

And somewhere below, a hollow-eyed young man named Torin waited, unaware his sister was coming to either save him or say goodbye.

Midnight approached.

---

Dawn came cold and gray.

They broke camp in silence, checked their weapons. If this came to violence, they'd already lost.

"Ready?" Mira asked, mounting her horse.

"No," he said. "But we're going anyway."

They rode out as the sun broke through. The road stretched north, empty.

With every mile, the weight settled heavier.

The valley appeared ahead. The ancient aqueducts stood against the pale sky.

They were a mile from the camp when Cassian felt it—a presence watching from the treeline.

He reined in. Mira drew her knife.

"Show yourself," Cassian called.

A figure emerged. Gray clothing, mechanical movements. Hollow.

But different.

The man stopped ten paces away, hands empty. His face was young but his eyes ancient. Empty. Yet something flickered there. A struggling consciousness.

"My name is Korrin," the man said. "I serve Draven Kane. I've been hollow three years. But..." He paused. "I can still feel fragments. Pieces of what I was."

"Then why warn us?" Cassian demanded. "Why not just take us to him?"

"Because I was ordered to intercept you. Stop you from reaching the camp." Korrin's voice was flat. "But it didn't specify how."

"That's a thin distinction."

"It's the only one I have." Something flickered in those empty eyes. "I can't betray my orders directly. But I can be... imprecise. Slow. I can watch you ride away and fail to pursue."

Mira's hand tightened on her knife. "What do you want?"

"Nothing. Everything." Korrin looked between them. "The new converts are in the western section. Three large tents at the valley's edge. Isolated until the change completes."

"How long does it take?"

"Four to six weeks."

"Three," Mira said. "He's been gone three weeks."

Korrin nodded slowly. "Then there might still be fragments. Echoes. Not much, but..." He paused, and for a moment his face was almost human. Almost alive. "But you can't just take him. He's bound. Only Draven can—" He stopped, jaw working like the words were being pulled from him against his will. "You'd need to reach him first. Make him remember. There are things even Draven can't fully control if the person fights back."

"If?" Cassian asked.

"Most don't want to." Korrin's voice went quiet. "The pain comes back if you remember. Everything you traded away returns. It's easier to stay empty."

Silence stretched between them.

"Wait until full dark," Korrin said finally. "Sentries rotate at midnight. Western approach, behind the supply tents. You'll have maybe twenty minutes."

He turned to leave.

"Why?" Mira called after him. "Why help us at all?"

Korrin stopped. His back was to them, rigid. "I had a sister. I think. I remember..." His voice caught. "I remember someone crying. I remember saying 'don't cry.' But I can't see her face." He looked back, and his eyes were hollow again. Empty. "I don't want anyone else to forget."

Then he was gone.

Cassian and Mira stared at the place he'd been.

"We're going to try this," Mira said. Not a question.

"We're going to try this," Cassian confirmed.

They had hours until midnight. Cassian found a sheltered spot in the rocks and closed his eyes, coin in hand. One more time, he needed to reach that gray space. Understand what he was walking into.

What it would cost him to save one hollow soul.

---

Midnight came with a sliver of moon and scattered clouds.

Cassian and Mira descended from the ridge in silence, keeping to the shadows. The Hollow camp sprawled below them—thousands of tents, hundreds of cookfires burning low, sentries moving in precise patterns.

Somewhere in the western section, Torin waited. Still human enough to save. Still hollow enough to be lost forever.

Cassian touched the coin one last time, feeling its warmth against his palm.

Then they moved forward, into the camp, into Draven's trap.

And for the first time since inheriting the coin, Cassian wondered if he would survive the night.
