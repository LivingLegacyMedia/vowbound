# Chapter 3: The Hollow

The first refugees arrived on a grey morning when the autumn mist still clung to the cobblestones.

Cassian was opening the counting house when he saw them—a ragged column of perhaps thirty people trudging through the market square. They moved with the defeated shuffle of those who'd walked too far on too little food. Children clung to their mothers' skirts. Old men leaned on makeshift canes. A woman carried a baby that didn't cry, which somehow seemed worse than if it had.

The townspeople stopped to stare. Refugees weren't uncommon—the kingdom had been at war for years, and displaced families often sought shelter in smaller towns. But something about these people was different. The way they flinched at sudden noises. The way their eyes darted constantly, as if expecting attack from any direction. The way they looked at the town with desperate hope mixed with bone-deep fear.

A baker's wife crossed herself and hurried back inside her shop. Two merchants stopped mid-haggle to watch the procession. Even the usual morning bustle of the market seemed to pause, as if the town itself held its breath.

"Poor souls," someone muttered nearby.

"Poor souls nothing," another voice hissed. "They'll bring trouble. Mark my words."

Cassian set down his ledger and walked toward the square. As he drew closer, the coin's perception activated. And what he saw troubled him.

Their shimmer was... *damaged*. Wounded. Like looking at a cracked mirror that still held its reflection, but distorted. They were still human, still themselves, but something had hurt them deeply. Left scars that went beyond the physical.

"Water," croaked an old man at the front of the column. "Please. The children—"

The magistrate's guards were already there, blocking the well. "No refugees without documentation," one said, hand on his sword hilt. "Orders from the magistrate. Too many mouths to feed already."

"We have money," the old man said desperately, fumbling at his belt. "We can pay—"

But when he opened his purse, only a few copper coins fell into his palm. Far too few for thirty people needing water, food, shelter.

Cassian stepped forward. "I'll pay for the water."

The guard turned, surprised. "Master Cassian?"

"They're thirsty. I'll cover the town's hospitality tax." He produced a silver coin—nearly a week's wages. "This should suffice for water and bread. At least for today."

The guard looked uncertain, but he took the coin. Town law was clear: pay the hospitality tax, gain entry. He couldn't refuse.

As the refugees were allowed to approach the well, the old man turned to Cassian. His eyes were gray and weary, but fierce. Still human. Still fighting.

"Thank you," the old man said quietly. Then, lower, almost a whisper: "But be careful, young man. The generous ones are often the first to fall."

Cassian frowned. "Why?"

"Because generosity means you care. And caring means you'll trade anything to protect those you love." The old man's voice dropped even lower. "They offer to save the people you help. To feed the hungry you can't feed. To heal the sick you can't heal. They make you feel responsible for every suffering soul, then offer to take that burden away. And the price..." He glanced at the children drinking eagerly from the well. "The price is always higher than you think. We escaped before they could finish what they started. But others..." He shook his head. "Just be careful. That's all I'm saying."

He moved toward the well to help organize the water distribution, leaving Cassian standing alone with an uneasy feeling in his chest.

---

By evening, the town council had called an emergency meeting.

The magistrate's hall was packed. Cassian stood near the back, watching the chaos unfold. Townspeople were shouting over each other, demanding answers, expressing fears. The refugees had been quartered in the old grain warehouse, but their presence had sparked panic.

"They're running from the Hollow!" someone shouted. "That means the Hollow is coming here!"

"We should send them away," another voice called. "Before they bring doom on us all!"

"They're just families with children," widow Marta protested. "Children, for mercy's sake. Would you turn them out to die?"

"Better them than us!"

Magistrate Torven raised his hands for silence. The gesture took several attempts before the crowd quieted enough for him to speak.

"The refugees will be allowed to stay for three days," Torven announced. "After that, they must move on. We cannot support them indefinitely. These are the terms."

"But where will they go?" Marta asked. "The Hollow are everywhere—"

"That's not our concern," Torven interrupted. "We have our own people to protect. Three days. Final decision."

As the crowd began to disperse, still muttering, Cassian noticed someone watching him from across the hall. A woman, perhaps forty years old, with steel-grey hair and sharp, evaluating eyes. She wore traveler's clothes, but they were well-made. Expensive. Dust-stained from long travel, but not tattered like the refugees.

He'd seen her before—at the well this morning. While the refugees drank, she'd stood at the edge of the crowd, not staring at the spectacle like the other townspeople. Staring at him. Studying the way he moved, the way he spoke. When he'd looked her direction, she'd simply nodded once and melted back into the market bustle.

Now here she was again. Their gazes met, and she smiled slightly. Recognition. Then she turned and slipped out of the hall.

---

Cassian found the refugees' spokesperson—the old man from that morning—in the warehouse after the meeting. The man was sitting on a crate, staring at nothing in particular.

"May I speak with you?" Cassian asked.

The old man looked up slowly. "The kind one. Yes. Sit, if you wish."

Cassian sat on an adjacent crate. Around them, families huddled in small groups, speaking in low voices. The atmosphere was oppressive—not just poverty and fear, but something deeper. Something wrong.

"What happened to your town?" Cassian asked quietly.

"We welcomed them," the old man said. His voice was flat, emotionless. "That was our mistake. The Hollow sent an emissary. A diplomat. He offered us peace. Protection. All we had to do was accept his terms."

"What terms?"

"They were... generous. Almost too generous. They would forgive our tax debts to the crown. Provide food for the hungry. Medicine for the sick. All they asked in return was that we acknowledge their authority. Sign a document. A formal agreement. It seemed harmless."

The old man's hands trembled slightly. "Our mayor signed it. The council signed it. We thought we were being clever. Practical. Why fight when we could negotiate?"

"What happened then?"

"Nothing. At first." The old man's voice dropped to barely a whisper. "They set up a trade post in the town square. Started offering... services. If you were suffering, they could take the suffering away. If you were grieving, they could erase the grief. If you owed debts, they could clear them. All through fair exchange, they said. Value for value. The Law of Balance made manifest."

Cassian felt cold. The Law of Balance. That sounded familiar.

"People accepted?" he asked.

"Oh, yes. Eagerly, at first. My neighbor's daughter had watched her son die of fever. The grief was destroying her. The Hollow offered to take it away—all her memories of him, all her pain. In exchange, she would serve them for a year. Just one year. She said yes." The old man's face was expressionless, but tears ran down his cheeks. "When she came back from their tent, she was smiling. Calm. Empty. She couldn't remember her son's name. Couldn't remember why she'd ever cared that he died."

Cassian stared at him, mind reeling. "Wait. They traded for... memories? Grief itself? How is that even possible?"

He thought of his own coin, hidden in his pocket. He'd used it to see value, to negotiate better terms, to understand what people truly wanted in material exchanges. Silver for information. Services for goods. But to literally *remove* emotions from someone's mind? To trade away parts of their soul? He'd never imagined such a thing was possible.

The old man's voice was hollow. "Draven has a power. A way of doing the impossible. He can reach inside you and take things that have no physical form. Memories. Emotions. The very essence of who you are." He stared at nothing. "Most people don't understand until it's too late. They think they're just making a deal. But he's taking pieces of their soul."

Cassian felt cold. What the old man was describing—it sounded like a twisted version of what his own coin could do. But surely not. Surely the coin couldn't do *that*.

Could it?

"And others did the same thing?" he asked, voice hoarse.

"Dozens. Then hundreds. The suffering ones went first. Then those with debts they couldn't pay. Then the ambitious ones, trading their uncertainty for confidence, their doubt for certainty. Each trade seemed fair. Each trade seemed voluntary. And each one left someone a little less human."

The old man's voice grew quieter, more distant, as if he were seeing it all again. "There was a baker. Good man. Salt of the earth. But his business was failing—bad harvests, competition from the guilds. He was going to lose everything. The Hollow offered him success. They'd give him knowledge, connections, the ability to bake bread that sold itself. In exchange..." He paused. "In exchange, he'd give them his love for his craft. His joy in the work."

"He agreed?"

"He thought he was being practical. Said he didn't need to love baking—he just needed to survive. But after..." Marcus shook his head. "He baked perfectly. His bread was flawless. But he did it like a man pulling weeds. Mechanically. Joylessly. His wife said he stopped smiling when he worked. Stopped talking about recipes and techniques. Just produced bread, sold it, counted his coins. Within a month, she couldn't stand to be near him. Said it was like living with a stranger wearing her husband's face."

Cassian felt cold. "What happened to him?"

"He made another trade. Said if he couldn't love his work, he didn't need to love his wife either. That love was just a distraction. The Hollow agreed. Took his love for her in exchange for... I don't even remember what. Something trivial. By the end, he'd traded away everything that made him who he was, piece by piece, always justifying it as necessity."

Another voice spoke up—a woman huddled nearby with two children. "My brother traded his fear," she said quietly. "He was terrified of the Hollow, of what they'd do to us. So when they offered to take his fear away in exchange for a few years of service, he jumped at it." Her voice broke. "But without fear, he had no caution. No judgment. He walked right into their army's camp a week later, smiling, ready to serve. I haven't seen him since."

Cassian's stomach turned. Fear. Love. Joy. Grief. All of them could be traded like currency. Plucked out of a person's soul and... what? Where did they go? Did Draven collect them somehow? Store them? Or did they simply cease to exist, leaving a void where humanity used to be?

He touched the coin through his pocket, and for the first time since finding it, he felt genuinely afraid of what it could do.

The old man looked directly at Cassian. "Some made only one trade. Lost a painful memory, or a grief they couldn't bear. You could still see them in there—muted, diminished. Others made several trades. Lost more and more each time. They lost their grief, then their joy, then love itself. By the end, they were..." He struggled for words. "Like puppets. Bodies moving, mouths speaking, but nothing behind the eyes. The Hollow calls them 'perfected.'"

He gestured helplessly. "Within three months, half the town had traded something away. The Hollow didn't need to fight us—we were divided against ourselves. Those who'd become hollow convinced their families to join them. Neighbors turned on neighbors. Some of us tried to resist, tried to hold out, but when the Hollow's army finally marched in, there was no one left to fight them. The hollow ones welcomed them. The rest of us fled."

"An army?" Cassian asked.

"Oh yes. Soldiers marched on us. But they didn't raise a sword or a dagger." The old man's voice was bitter. "Why fight when you can just wait? When you can offer people exactly what they think they want, and let them give up everything that makes them who they are? By the time the army arrives, the city is already theirs."

Cassian sat in silence, processing this. The coin in his pocket felt heavier than usual.

"Who leads them?" he finally asked.

"Their master calls himself the Supreme Voice. Draven Kane." The old man spoke the name like a curse. "They say he's beautiful. Articulate. That when he speaks, you want to agree with him. That he can make emptiness sound like enlightenment."

"Have you seen him?"

"No. But I knew someone who met him. A merchant from our town, named Corvas. The Hollow invited him to negotiate under a flag of truce. When Corvas came back, he was... different. He kept saying, 'Draven makes sense. It all makes sense. Why should we suffer when we can trade suffering away? Why should we cling to love when love only brings pain?' Within a week, Corvas had convinced his whole family to accept the Hollow's offer. All six of them became hollow together." 

The old man leaned closer. "That's what you need to understand, young man. Draven Kane doesn't just conquer through violence. He divides cities from within. Turns neighbor against neighbor. And then, when half the people have already sided with him, his army just walks in. No battle needed."

Cassian felt cold. "How do you fight that?"

"I don't know," the old man said wearily. "That's why we're here. Running. Hoping the next town can do what we couldn't."

A woman's voice spoke from behind them. "He's right."

Cassian turned to find the grey-haired woman from the town hall standing a few paces away. She looked at the old man with sympathy—and something else. Recognition.

"Marcus," she said quietly. "I heard your town fell. I'm sorry."

The old man's eyes widened. "Seris? You're alive? We thought—when the guild house burned—"

"I wasn't there," she said. "I'd already left. Following leads your guild contacts gave me." She glanced at Cassian, then back to Marcus. "You've shared enough. Rest now. I'll speak with Rowan's son."

Marcus looked at Cassian with new understanding. "Rowan's son..." He nodded slowly. "Yes, I see." Then without another word, he shuffled away toward his family, leaving Cassian alone with the woman.

"You knew the refugees?" Cassian asked.

"I knew their town," Seris said. "My guild had contacts there—scholars, record-keepers. Marcus was one of them. He helped us research the artifacts." Her face hardened. "When the Hollow came, they burned the guild house first. Killed anyone who might know how to resist them. Marcus escaped, but..." She shook her head. "He lost more than his town."

She studied Cassian. "Rowan was your father."

It wasn't a question.

"How did you know him?" Cassian asked warily.

"Walk with me," she said. "We should talk somewhere more private."

---

They walked through the dark streets of Millhaven, the woman keeping to the shadows with practiced ease—someone accustomed to not being noticed. The warehouse district was quiet at this hour, only the occasional watchman's lantern breaking the darkness.

Finally, she stopped in the shelter of an old grain merchant's alcove and turned to face him.

"You said your name was Seris," Cassian said. "Tell me how you knew my father."

"Your father and I were colleagues—part of  guild that studies ancient artifacts. Dangerous artifacts." Her eyes were sharp in the dim light. "I received word of Rowan's death three weeks ago. I've been traveling since then to reach you."

"Why did you want to reach me?" Cassian asked.

"Because your father gave me something before his last expedition; eight years ago, when he sensed he might not return. He made me promise: if anything happened to him, I should give it to you." She paused, her voice dropping. "But only if you'd inherited his gift."

"His gift?" Cassian feigned ignorance.

"The one in your left pocket." Her voice was sharp. "I arrived in Millhaven two days ago. I've been watching you—the way you study people, as if pondering things invisible to others. The way you pause before speaking, seeing things no one else can see. The way you paid for the refugees this morning without hesitation. Not out of simple kindness, but because you *saw* something." She met his eyes. "The same way your father used to see things."

Cassian's hand moved instinctively toward his pocket, where the coin rested.

Seris smiled slightly, but there was grief in it. "Yes. The artifact your father spent his life searching for. He found it, didn't he? And now you have it."

She pulled something from her cloak—a small leather journal, worn and water-stained. For a long moment, she held it close to her chest, reluctant. When she finally extended it toward him, her hand trembled slightly.

"This belonged to Rowan. The guild wanted it destroyed when he died. They believe artifacts like his—like yours—are too dangerous. That they should be locked away where no one can use them." She pressed the journal into his hands. "But your father believed differently. He thought such things could be used for good. To help people. I want to believe he was right."

Cassian held it carefully. His father's handwriting was visible on the cover: *Notes and Observations*.

"Why are you giving this to me?"

Seris looked away, and for the first time her composure cracked. "Your father was my friend. More than that—he was the only one in the guild who still believed the coins could save people instead of damn them. When he died..." Her voice tightened. "The faction that wants the coins destroyed grew stronger. The faction that wants them weaponized grew bolder. Those of us who agreed with Rowan?" A bitter smile. "We're being hunted by both sides now."

She met his eyes again, fierce. "I couldn't save your father. Maybe I can help you survive what's coming."

"What is coming?"

"War. But not the kind you can fight with swords." She glanced over her shoulder, suddenly wary. "You need to understand what you're facing. That journal contains your father's research on Draven Kane—the man leading the Hollow. Draven has an artifact like yours. But he's corrupted it somehow. Found a way to transfer the cost of his trades onto others. When he makes an exchange, he doesn't pay the price—they do. Each trade takes a piece of them. Their suffering. Their love. Their memories. Until nothing human remains."

"How is that possible?" Cassian said, thinking of how his coin works.

"It shouldn't be," Seris agreed. "But somehow he does it. Your father was trying to explain that riddle when he died. He suspected Draven had made some kind of fundamental bargain. Something that broke the normal rules."

She glanced over her shoulder again, more urgently this time. "I can't stay. The guild has had people watching Millhaven since your father's death. They know about you—some want to recruit you, some want to stop you. And some..." She paused. "We suspect some work for Draven now. We just don't know who."

"When will I see you again?"

"Soon. There are things beneath this town your father wanted you to see—old places, old knowledge buried in the catacombs. But not yet. The magistrate's guards are watching you after what you did this morning. Too many eyes. We need to wait until it's safer." She started to back away into the shadows. "Read the journal. Learn what your father discovered. And be ready. The Hollow knows the refugees are here now. They'll send someone. Probably within the three days the magistrate granted them."

"How do I know I can trust you?"

A sad smile crossed her face. "You don't. And you shouldn't trust anyone completely. That's what your father would tell you. But he believed these artifacts could save people instead of destroying them. I want to see if he was right." 

She disappeared into the darkness before Cassian could ask anything more.

He stood alone in the street, holding his father's journal.

After a long moment, he opened it.

The first page read:

*Day 2,847 of bearing the coin. I've made 1,653 trades. Each one fair. Each one balanced. But Draven has made thousands more—and none of them cost him anything.*

*The artifact is not evil. But it can be used for evil. The difference lies not in the power, but in what one chooses to trade. Draven trades humanity itself. He's found a way to make others pay his debts. Every trade he makes, someone else loses a piece of themselves.*

*I've tried matching his method. I can't. Won't. The coin won't let me cheat the Law—it demands I pay my own costs. But Draven broke something fundamental. Made a trade so profound it changed the rules themselves.*

*My theory: He traded away his own humanity first. Voluntarily. Completely. Made himself hollow so he'd have nothing left to lose. And in exchange, he gained the power to trade freely—at everyone else's expense.*

*If I'm right, he's not human anymore. Not in any way that matters. He's a void that feeds on others. And I don't know how to fight a void.*

*Possible counter: Trade something equally fundamental. But what could match trading away your own soul? Love? Memory? Life itself? I don't have the answer yet.*

---

Cassian read late into the night by lamplight in his room.

His father's journal was dense with observations, theories, fragments of research. Notes on the artifact Rowan had sought his whole life. Speculation about its nature and limitations. Warnings about its dangers.

And scattered throughout, a recurring question:

*How do I stop someone who's learned to trade without paying the price?*

Rowan had never found the answer.

Now it fell to Cassian to try.

He was still reading when dawn began to grey the windows. His eyes burned with fatigue, but his mind was racing with what he'd learned.

Draven Kane had an artifact like his. But Draven had corrupted it somehow. Found a way to make others pay the costs of his trades. Built an empire on stolen humanity.

And now the Hollow was spreading. Town by town. Trade by trade. Offering people exactly what they thought they wanted, then hollowing them out from within. And when enough people in a city had been turned, Draven's army simply marched in. No siege needed. No battle. The city divided against itself could not stand.

*It's brilliant,* Cassian realized with horror. *And it works because they choose it for themselves. They agree to the terms. How do you fight an army that people surrender to wilingly?*

A commotion outside interrupted his thoughts.

He went to the window and looked down at the market square. A crowd was gathering. And in the center stood a figure in grey and white.

The Hollow had sent their emissary.

---

By the time Cassian reached the square, half the town had assembled. The figure stood calmly in the center, making no threatening moves. He was young, handsome in a sculptured way, with a pleasant smile and empty eyes.

Two guards flanked him at a respectful distance—not prisoners escort, but honor guard. They wore the grey and white of the Hollow, armor polished to mirror brightness. Neither moved. Neither blinked. Their shimmers, through Cassian's sixth sense, were almost nonexistent. Hollow. Completely hollow.

"I am Valen," he announced, his voice carrying easily. "Emissary of the Hollow. I come under flag of truce to deliver a message to the people of Millhaven."

Magistrate Torven pushed through the crowd, guards at his flanks. "We want nothing from you. Leave our town."

"Of course, Magistrate. As soon as I've delivered my message." Valen's smile remained pleasant. "The Hollow wishes to extend an offer of peace. We understand you harbor refugees from the east. We bear them no ill will. In fact, we'd welcome them back."

He let that sink in, then continued. "All we ask is that Millhaven sign a simple trade agreement. Acknowledge our authority in the eastern provinces. In exchange, we guarantee your safety. Your autonomy. Your prosperity."

"We bow to no tyrant," someone shouted from the crowd.

Valen looked genuinely puzzled. "Tyrant? We offer freedom. Freedom from suffering. Freedom from want. All through fair exchange." His gaze swept the crowd, and Cassian saw people flinch when those empty eyes passed over them. "How many of you struggle with debt? With hunger? With grief? The Hollow can help. All we ask is that you trade freely. Value for value. Your pain for peace."

A woman near the front spoke up, voice trembling. "What happened to the refugees' town? To their families?"

"They made choices," Valen said simply. "Some chose wisdom. Some chose fear. The wise prosper under the Hollow's protection. The fearful..." He shrugged. "They run. And running solves nothing."

"You're offering servitude," an old merchant said. "Dressed up in pretty words, but servitude nonetheless."

"I'm offering clarity," Valen corrected. "For too long, you've suffered under kings and magistrates who take your taxes and give nothing in return. Who send your sons to die in wars you never chose. Who let you starve while nobles feast. The Hollow offers something better: honest exchange. You give value, you receive value. No more false promises. No more empty hope. Just fair trade."

His words were reasonable. Logical. And Cassian could see they were landing quite well with people in the crowd. A blacksmith whose shop was failing. A farmer's wife whose husband had died in the king's war. A young man crushed by debts he could never repay.

Valen was offering them exactly what they needed. And he meant it. The trade would be fair. By the coin's reckoning, by the Law of Balance, it would all be perfectly fair.

They'd just lose everything that made them human in the process.

Cassian watched from the edge of the crowd, studying the emissary with his sixth sense.

The shimmer around Valen was strong, but different. Not empty like the guards, but twisted. Distorted. Like looking at a reflection in warped glass. The man was human—or had been once—but something fundamental had been altered.

"May we have three days to consider?" Magistrate Torven asked, his voice tight.

"Three days would be generous," Valen agreed pleasantly. "We'll send a representative to receive your answer then." He bowed slightly. "Choose wisely. We won't make this offer twice."

He turned and walked away, moving through the crowd. People stepped back from him instinctively, creating a clear path. His two guards followed in synchronized movement.

When they were gone, the square erupted in chaos. Some wanted to fight. Others wanted to accept. Many just wanted to flee.

"We could send riders to the King—"

"The King is three weeks away! They'll be here in three days!"

"Maybe the offer isn't so bad. I mean, if we just acknowledge their authority—"

"You want to end up like those refugees? Like those guards? Empty husks?"

"Better alive and empty than slaughtered in our beds!"

Cassian stood silent, watching it all. Watching the fear do exactly what the Hollow wanted it to do—divide the town, fracture their unity, make them desperate enough to consider the unthinkable.

This was how they won. Not with armies. Not with violence. With offers that sounded reasonable until you realized the price. With trades that seemed fair until you discovered what you'd actually given away.

In his pocket, the coin felt warm against his palm. And in his mind, his father's words echoed:

*How do I stop someone who's learned to trade without paying the price?*

Three days.

That's all the time he had to figure out how to fight an enemy who made evil look like mercy. Who corrupted the same power Cassian wielded. Who offered people exactly what they thought they wanted and hollowed out their soul.

Across the square, Cassian saw Marcus standing in the warehouse doorway, watching the crowd's panic with weary, knowing eyes. The old man had seen this before. Had lived through it. And he knew how it ended.

The war had come to Millhaven.

And Cassian still didn't know how to fight it.
