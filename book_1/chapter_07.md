# Chapter 7: The Traitor

The war council met in a circular chamber. A round table dominated the room—a symbol of equality, though the man at its head clearly held more power than the others. King Aldric himself, gray-bearded and grim-faced, watched as Cassian was led inside.

Around the table sat perhaps twenty people—nobles, military commanders, scholars in academic robes. They looked up as Cassian entered, and he saw the judgment in their eyes. Who was this nobody from nowhere? What could a village ledger-keeper possibly tell them that their own advisors hadn't already said?

Lord Herrick stood at the King's right hand. "Your Majesty, honored council, this is Cassian of Millhaven. He claims knowledge of the Hollow's methods."

"Claims," someone muttered. A nobleman in expensive red velvet. "Another peasant with empty theories."

Cassian ignored him. He bowed to the King. "Your Majesty. Thank you for hearing me."

King Aldric gestured to an empty chair. His voice was rougher than Cassian expected, gravelly with exhaustion. "Sit. Speak. We're listening. Though I'll warn you—we've heard seventeen advisors this week. Sixteen are now in the dungeon for wasting our time. Try not to be the seventeenth."

Cassian sat. Twenty pairs of eyes fixed on him. He took a breath.

Before he could speak, a general—perhaps sixty, with scars across his knuckles and a face that had seen too many battles—spoke up. "Your Majesty, with respect, we've already discussed defensive strategies. We fortify the eastern approach, station archers on the high walls, and we can hold them for weeks. What can this... ledger-keeper possibly add?"

"You can't hold them at all," Cassian said. The room went silent. "Not with conventional defenses. You're preparing for the wrong kind of siege."

"Explain," King Aldric said.

"Every day your soldiers stand on those walls, Draven will be below offering them peace. An end to their fear. Their pain. Their doubts about whether this city is worth dying for." Cassian met the general's gaze. "How long before your own defenders open the gates from the inside? How do you command an army when half of them would rather surrender than fight?"

That landed. Several council members shifted uncomfortably.

The general's face darkened. "My soldiers are loyal—"

"Your soldiers are human. And Draven has perfected the art of exploiting that." Cassian leaned forward. "But there's a weakness in his method. The Hollow's methods require conversation. Persuasion. They need to speak with your soldiers in order to negotiate."

"So?" the general said. "How does that help us?"

"Silence the Hollow," Cassian said simply. "The moment they approach your walls, sound the war drums. Constant, deafening rhythm. Horns. Bells. Battle cries in rotation—different companies shouting different chants so there's never a moment of quiet. Make it impossible for the Hollow to be heard."

The room went quiet as they considered this.

"They can't offer trades if no one can hear the offer," Cassian continued. "And even if a few words get through, the Hollow's method requires careful, personal appeals. They need to speak to each person's specific pain. Generic shouts won't work—they need individual conversations. Deny them that, and they're just ordinary soldiers. Worse, actually, because they fight without fear or self-preservation. They'll throw themselves at your walls carelessly while your defenders have every reason to stay alive."

The general's expression shifted from skepticism to interest. "That...could be effective. It's remarkably simple."

"The best strategies often are," Cassian said. "Draven's power is in understanding what people want. Rob him of the ability to communicate that understanding, and he's lost his greatest weapon."

"His power," the King repeated slowly. "You speak as if it's more than just persuasion. As if there's something... supernatural about his ability to sway people."

Cassian hesitated. This was dangerous territory. But the King was sharp—he'd caught the implication. There was no point in half-truths now.

"It is more than persuasion, Your Majesty," Cassian said carefully. "Draven possesses an artifact. A medallion of immense power that allows him to perceive what people value most—their fears, their loves, their desperate needs. It grants him insight into the human heart that no ordinary person could have. That's why his offers are so perfectly tailored, so impossible to resist. He knows exactly what each person wants before they speak."

The room went very quiet.

Lord Herrick leaned forward. "An artifact. You're certain of this?"

"Yes."

"How?" the King demanded. "How could you possibly know this? Such artifacts are legend—stories from the Age of Fragments. Even if they existed once, they're long lost."

Cassian felt the weight of the coin in his pocket, warm against his chest. He could deflect. Claim his father's research, refugee accounts, educated guesses. But the King's eyes were boring into him, and the lie would be transparent.

"Because I possess one too," Cassian said. He pulled the coin from his pocket and set it on the table.

The reaction was immediate. Gasps. Several people stood. The general's hand went to his sword hilt. But King Aldric held up a hand, silencing them.

"Peace," the King said. He studied the coin with intense focus, and Cassian saw something flicker in his eyes. Recognition? Fear? "I've heard stories of such artifacts. My grandfather's grandfather spoke of them in his journals. But I thought they were legend."

"They're real," Cassian said. "This coin grants me insight into value—into what people want, what they fear, what they'd trade away. It's how I understand Draven's methods so well. He has one too, but he's corrupted his. Found a way to profit without paying the price. To make trades where others bear his costs. That's how the Hollow came to be. Every person among them is carrying debts that should have been Draven's."

"That never happened in the old stories," someone said.

"Normally it *can't* happen, but Draven learned how to use his gift to exploit others." Cassian picked up the coin, felt its warmth. "And he's perfected the technique. He's been doing this for years, building his power, creating an army of debt-bearers. And now—" He looked at the King. "Now he's coming here. To your city. Because there's another coin hidden somewhere in this capital city. And if he gets it, he'll be unstoppable."

The silence that followed was deafening.

Finally, King Aldric spoke. "How do you know there's a coin here?"

"Because I can feel it," Cassian said simply. "The coins recognize each other. Mine has been growing warmer since I entered the city. There's another fragment close. Very close."

Herrick and the King exchanged a look. Something passed between them—confirmation, perhaps. Or concern.

The general stood abruptly. "Your Majesty, with respect—if this coin is what draws Draven here, then this man makes the entire city a target. We should confiscate it. Lock it away. Get it out of the capital entirely."

"Agreed," said another nobleman. "For the safety of the realm—"

"You can't," Cassian interrupted. His hand closed protectively around the coin. "It's bonded to me. When my father died, it... chose me, I suppose. I don't fully understand it myself, but I know it won't work for anyone else. Not anymore."

"That's convenient," the general said coldly. "A peasant shows up claiming to have a magical artifact that makes him indispensable—"

"I do not make empty claims," Cassian said, keeping his voice level despite his rising pulse. "My father researched these coins for twenty years. They bond with their bearers. You can take it from me, but it will be useless to you. And if Draven is coming for it anyway, at least with me you have someone who knows how to use it."

The King held up a hand. "Enough. Master Cassian—is what the general says true? Does your presence here make us more of a target?"

Cassian met his gaze. No point in lying. "Yes. If Draven can sense fragments the way I can sense them... then yes, he likely knows I'm here. Or will soon."

Several council members erupted in protest. The King silenced them with a sharp gesture.

"Then we're already committed," King Aldric said grimly. "If he's coming either way, better to have two coins on our side than one on his. But Master Cassian—" His voice hardened. "Know that you've just made yourself the most valuable person in this city. And the most watched. If you betray us, if you so much as think about taking that coin to our enemy, you'll beg for death long before we grant it. Am I clear?"

Cassian swallowed. "Yes, Your Majesty."

"Good." The King looked around the council. "Now. We have other business. Specifically, the matter of Lord Corvan's alleged treason."

Cassian had almost forgotten. The summons had mentioned a traitor in the court.

"Bring him in," the King commanded.

---

Guards escorted Lord Corvan into the chamber. He was a tall man, perhaps fifty, with silver hair and the bearing of someone used to authority. But his hands were bound, and his fine clothes were rumpled from days in the dungeon. He looked exhausted. Broken.

But when his eyes met Cassian's, something flickered there. Recognition? No—calculation.

"Lord Corvan," the King said. "You stand accused of treason. Of communicating with Draven Kane. Of offering to sabotage our defenses in exchange for sparing your family's lands. How do you answer these charges?"

Corvan's voice was hoarse but steady. "I met with him. I won't deny it."

Murmurs around the table. The general looked furious. The nobles shocked.

"Why?" the King demanded.

"Because you summoned me to this city to lead your defenses, Your Majesty. I needed to understand what we were fighting. So I arranged a meeting under flag of truce. I went to his camp. I met him in his tent."

Corvan's gaze went distant, remembering. "I expected a warlord. A monster. Instead, I found a gentleman in fine clothes, sitting in a campaign chair, reading poetry. Horace, I think. Or maybe Virgil. He offered me wine. Expensive wine, from the southern provinces. We talked."

"About what?" Herrick demanded.

"About philosophy. About the nature of worth and power. About what men sacrifice for duty." Corvan's voice was quiet now, careful. "He was... magnificent. Articulate. He said that a father's first duty was to his children. That protecting one's family wasn't weakness—it was the only true loyalty. And when a man must choose between the lives of strangers and the lives of his own..." He trailed off.

"Then he made you an offer," the King said.

"Yes, Your Majesty. My cooperation for my family's safety. He would spare my lands, spare my children, let them grow old in peace. All I had to do was delay the fortification of the eastern walls. A small thing. A technical delay. He said it wouldn't even matter—that the war was already lost, and I was simply choosing which side to mourn on."

"But it would have left us vulnerable," the general said. "The eastern approach is crucial. If they breach there—"

"I know," Corvan said quietly. "I understood the consequences. But in that moment, sitting across from Draven Kane, drinking his wine, listening to his arguments—I couldn't think of anything but my children. Their faces. Their futures. Everything else seemed..." He shook his head. "Distant. Abstract. Like it was happening to other people in another life."

He looked at the King, his voice breaking. "That's what he does, Your Majesty. He doesn't force you. He doesn't threaten. He just... shows you what you value most. Makes it so vivid, so immediate, that everything else fades. And in that clarity, terrible choices seem reasonable."

The room was silent.

"Did you accept his offer?" the King asked quietly.

Corvan closed his eyes. "Yes. God help me, yes. I agreed. I traded my loyalty for a promise."

"Then you admit your treason."

"I admit that I was weak. That I let him show me what I valued most, and I chose it over duty." Corvan opened his eyes. "But I never acted on it. The moment I returned to the city, the weight of what I'd agreed to crashed down on me. The guilt. The shame. I couldn't do it. So I did nothing. Stalled. Made excuses. And eventually, your investigators found correspondence I was too careless to destroy."

He looked directly at Cassian. That calculating look. "So here I am. A traitor by intent if not by action. Awaiting your judgment."

King Aldric was quiet for a long moment. Then he turned to Cassian. "You said you understand trade. Tell me—is this man telling the truth?"

All eyes turned to Cassian. He felt the weight of the question. Felt the coin warm against his palm.

He focused on Corvan, letting his perception open. Saw the values of the man. Saw shame, thick and dark. Saw regret. And underneath—something that gave him pause.

The impressions came in fragments: *Children. Love. Loss.* But the quality felt wrong. Distant and thin, like hearing music through a wall. Like echoes of emotions rather than the emotions themselves.

Was it a hollowed soul? Or simply a great weight of trauma and guilt? Cassian couldn't tell for certain.

"I do know that He's telling the truth," Cassian said carefully. "He made the trade. He regrets it. The guilt is genuine."

Relief flickered across several faces. Even Corvan looked grateful.

But the nagging doubt remained. Was he sensing Draven's manipulation, or was he simply inexperienced—seeing shadows where there were none? After what the Dealer had told him, he was primed to find corruption everywhere. Corvan's guilt looked real. His regret looked real.

Cassian pushed the doubt aside.

"Execute him," the general said flatly. "Treason is treason, whether acted upon or not."

Several council members nodded agreement.

"Wait," Cassian heard himself say.

Everyone turned to him.

"Your Majesty," Cassian said, his mind racing. "Lord Corvan was one of your most capable commanders before this. You trusted him to lead the eastern defenses. That trust wasn't misplaced—he has strategic knowledge, military experience, connections throughout your forces. Executing him wastes all of that."

"He's a traitor," someone objected. "We can't—"

"He attempted treason," Cassian corrected. "And he stopped himself. Reported his own crime." He looked at Corvan, seeing the man with his coin-sense. The guilt. The shame. And underneath it all—fierce, desperate love for his children. That was the weakness Draven had exploited. "The question is: why did he almost betray you?"

"For his family," Herrick said quietly. "Draven offered to spare his lands. His children."

"Exactly." Cassian turned to the King. "Lord Corvan is valuable. Experienced. But he has a vulnerability that your enemy knows how to exploit. As long as he has people he loves more than his duty, Draven can use them against him." He paused. "What if we removed that vulnerability?"

The room went quiet.

"What are you suggesting?" the King asked carefully.

Cassian met his gaze. "The coin I possess can execute bargains. This includes bargains for one's memories. If Lord Corvan were willing—if he agreed—I could take the memories of his children from him. Their faces. Their voices. Every moment he's spent with them. Everything that makes them precious to him."

Corvan made a strangled sound.

"Without those memories," Cassian continued, voice steady despite the horror of what he was proposing, "Draven loses his leverage. Lord Corvan would have no family to protect, no weakness to exploit. He could serve you without that vulnerability. And in exchange for this... sacrifice... he gives you everything he knows about Draven's forces, his strategies, his plans. And he lives."

"That's monstrous," someone breathed.

"Yes," Cassian agreed quietly. "It is. But it's also necessary. You lose nothing—he was going to be executed anyway. Instead, you gain an experienced commander who can't be turned, and critical intelligence about your enemy. Lord Corvan loses much that matters to him, but he is allowed to live. To serve. He can redeem himself through years of loyal service, knowing he once had children but unable to remember why he cared about them."

He looked at Corvan. "It's a cruel mercy. But you keep much more than you would if executed."

Corvan's face had gone pale. "My children. You want me to forget my children?"

"I want to give you a choice," Cassian said. "Die with those memories intact, knowing you nearly betrayed everything for them and failed. Or live without them. Serve the King with no divided loyalties. Be the commander you were before Draven found your weakness." He paused. "Your children will live on. You just won't know them. You won't be vulnerable through them."

"That's not living," Corvan whispered. "That's—"

"That's the best I can do," Cassian said. "Your life and your service, in exchange for every memory that makes you exploitable. I understand that it's devastating. But you conspired with the enemy. Cruel mercy may be the best you can hope for."

The King was studying both of them intently. "Lord Herrick?"

Herrick looked troubled. "Lord Corvan is—was—one of our finest military minds. We can't trust him. But if his vulnerability were truly removed..." He trailed off. "It's barbaric. But we're at war. We need capable commanders."

"And the intelligence?" the general asked. "How do we verify it?"

"My coin grants insight into value," Cassian said. "Into truth and deception. I can sense when someone is lying—their words feel hollow, weightless. When they speak truth, especially painful truth, I feel the substance of it. Lord Corvan speaks everything he knows, and I verify it as best I can."

"But how do we know you can actually do this?" a nobleman challenged. "Remove memories? That's fantasy. You could be offering impossible terms just to delay his execution."

"A fair point," the King said, his eyes fixed on Cassian. "Can you prove this power of yours? Before we let a condemned traitor bargain with his life?"

Cassian felt the weight of the room's skepticism. He'd only seen this done once—by the Dealer, who'd ripped his mother's face from his mind with terrible precision. He'd never attempted it himself. But the principle seemed sound: the coin facilitated willing trades, and memories had value.

"I believe I can," Cassian said carefully. "But I've never attempted it before. There's risk—it could damage his mind, or fail completely."

The King held up a hand. "Lord Corvan. Do you accept the risk? That it may damage your mind in ways we cannot predict? And do you accept the trade—your memories of your children, for your life and chance to serve again?"

Corvan looked at Cassian, then at the King. Silence stretched out. Cassian could see the war happening behind the man's eyes—love battling survival, desperation battling horror.

Finally, Corvan spoke, his voice barely a whisper. "If I do this... if I give up those memories... will they know? My children. Will they know their father forgot them?"

"They'll know you serve the King," Herrick said quietly. "They'll know you chose duty."

"They'll think I abandoned them," Corvan said. "Chose loyalty to the crown over love for them."

"Yes," Cassian said. There was no point in softening it. "They will."

Corvan closed his eyes. Tears streamed down his face. When he opened them again, there was a terrible resignation there. "What the King is offering me is poetically just, given my crime. I agreed to sacrifice the kingdom for my children. Now I must sacrifice my children—or at least my memory of them—for the kingdom." He looked at his bound hands. "I'll still have lost something precious. But I'll have a renewed, singular focus on protecting the realm. Which might at least help save my family from the destruction I nearly caused."

He met Cassian's gaze. "I accept. Make the trade. Take every memory. Turn me into someone Draven can't use. Someone who can serve without being turned."

The King studied them both for a long moment. Then he nodded. "Very well. Master Cassian—please try to remove the memories. If you succeed, Lord Corvan may share his intelligence and live. If you fail..." He looked at Corvan. "We'll give you a swift execution."

The room went silent.

Cassian's hands trembled as he stood. The guards brought Corvan forward. Up close, Cassian could see the terror and resignation warring in the man's eyes.

"Are you certain?" Cassian asked quietly.

"No," Corvan whispered. "But do it anyway. Before I change my mind."

Cassian pressed the coin between his palms. It grew warm immediately, almost hot, responding to the weight of what was being offered. He focused his perception on Corvan, searching for the threads of memory connected to his children.

There. He could sense them—not one memory, but thousands, woven throughout Corvan's entire life. A daughter's first breath. Teaching his son to ride. Bedtime stories. Proud moments and fearful ones. Joy and worry and fierce, protective love. They were everywhere, threaded through everything, part of the fundamental architecture of who Corvan was.

"This will hurt," Cassian warned. "Not physically. But after... you'll know something is missing. But you won't know them. Not what they meant to you."

"I understand," Corvan said. "Do it."

Cassian reached out mentally, grasping at those threads of memory. The coin grew searingly hot, facilitating the connection. This wasn't precise surgery—it was extraction on a massive scale. Every memory tagged with love for his children, being pulled away like roots yanked from soil.

For a moment, Cassian could feel them all flooding through him—a daughter's laugh, so bright it hurt. A son asking impossible questions. Teaching them. Protecting them. Worrying about their futures. The weight of being responsible for lives you'd die to protect.

Then the coin absorbed it all, pulling the memories into itself where they dissolved into nothing. Gone. Not transferred. Simply erased. The trade complete: Corvan's vulnerability for his life and service.

The extraction took perhaps thirty seconds. When it ended, both men staggered. Cassian caught himself on the table's edge, gasping. His nose was bleeding slightly. The coin was cooling in his palm.

Corvan stood swaying, his face slack with shock. For a long moment, he just stared at nothing.

"Lord Corvan," the King said carefully. "Are you well?"

Corvan blinked slowly, as if waking from a dream. "I... yes. I think so." He looked around the room, confused. "Why do I feel... numb?"

"Your children," Herrick said quietly. "Do you remember them?"

A long pause. Corvan's face showed confusion, then something worse—awareness without connection. "I... have children?" It wasn't quite a question. More like discovering a fact about a stranger. "How many?"

"I think it's best not to say." the King said.

Corvan nodded slowly, processing this information the way one might process any neutral information. "I see." No emotion. No recognition. Just... acceptance of fact. He tested the words in his mouth. "I have children." Then something flickered in his eyes—understanding without feeling. "They're why I'm here, aren't they? The treason. I was trying to protect them."

"Yes," Cassian said quietly.

"But I don't..." Corvan's voice caught. Not with emotion, but with the recognition of its absence. "I don't feel anything. I know I should. I know they're mine. But they're just..." He looked at his hands. "What did I do?"

The room was deathly silent. Several council members looked shaken. Even the King seemed disturbed by what they'd witnessed.

"Someone who can serve without being turned," the King said finally, though his voice lacked its earlier certainty. "Someone Draven can no longer exploit."

The room remained silent for a long moment, everyone processing what they'd witnessed. Several nobles looked ill. Even the general seemed shaken.

Finally, the King cleared his throat. "It is complete. You live, Lord Corvan. And now you'll tell us everything you know."

Corvan nodded slowly, mechanically. "Yes. I'll tell you everything." His voice was unfeeling. "I have no reason to withhold from you, my King."

And so he spoke.

He described Draven's camp in detail—the layout, the number of tents, the divisions of forces. He described the man himself: calm, articulate, reading poetry in a campaign chair, making treason sound like wisdom. He described the maps he'd seen spread across a table, positions marked in red.

His voice was steady now. Almost detached.

"He's planning a two-pronged assault," Corvan said. "The main force will approach from the east, as you expect. But he's sending a smaller force—perhaps three thousand—to the north. They'll strike at the supply depots outside the city walls while the main army engages your eastern defenses."

The general was scribbling notes frantically. "When?"

"Tomorrow night. New moon. Dark enough to approach undetected." Corvan's voice was steadier now, as if speaking freely was itself a relief. "He's been moving forces for weeks. Your scouts didn't see them because they're traveling in small groups, converging just outside your patrols' range."

More questions. More details. Troop compositions, supply lines, the location of Draven's command tent, the types of contracts his emissaries carry. Corvan answered everything, holding nothing back.

Cassian stood nearby, focusing his coin-sense on each word despite his exhaustion. Most of it rang true—heavy with substance, carefully remembered. Real information.

Cassian frowned, trying to understand what he was sensing. Was Corvan lying about certain details? Or had Draven fed him false information, knowing it would be extracted?

Finally, the King held up a hand. "Enough. Master Cassian—your assessment?"

Cassian chose his words carefully. "Most of what he's said is genuine. He believes it, and the memories are real. But some details feel secondhand. As if he's remembering what Draven told him rather than what he saw directly. It's possible Draven intentionally fed him false intelligence, knowing Lord Corvan might betray it."

"Which details?" the general demanded.

"The northern force's size and timing. The new moon attack. Those feel... rehearsed. Like someone wanted him to remember them exactly that way." Cassian looked at Corvan. "Did Draven repeat those specific details multiple times during your meeting?"

Corvan thought about it with the same detached precision. "Yes. He mentioned the northern assault three separate times. Made sure I understood the timing."

"Then it's likely misdirection," Cassian said. "The rest—the camp layout, the maps, Draven's demeanor—that all feels genuine. But the specific military intelligence he wanted you to remember? That's suspect."

The King nodded slowly. "A trap within a confession. Clever." He looked at the general. "Verify what we can. Send scouts to check the northern approach, but don't commit forces based on that intelligence alone. Plan for attacks from multiple directions."

He turned to Corvan. "You've proven valuable, Lord Corvan. More valuable alive than dead, it seems. You'll be assigned to Lord Herrick's command. You'll serve under close watch, but you'll serve. That was the bargain."

Corvan nodded slowly, mechanically.

The King nodded. Then turned his head. "Master Cassian—" His eyes were calculating now. "You've proven your value today. Your strategy for defending against the Hollow's psychological attacks. Your ability to verify truth. Your... extraction method." He paused. "You'll have a place in this court. But know that what you've demonstrated today has made you both indispensable and dangerous. Do you understand?"

"Yes, Your Majesty."

"Good." The King looked around the council. "We have much to prepare. General, implement Master Cassian's noise strategy immediately. I want drums, horns, and battle cries ready before Draven's forces arrive. And send scouts to verify these troop positions—all of them, not just the northern approach."

The council session continued for another hour, but Cassian barely registered it. Orders were issued. Forces deployed. Scouts sent to verify Corvan's intelligence. The general argued about defensive positions, nobles rushed to secure their estates.

Finally, Lord Herrick dismissed him. "The King wants you available tomorrow. Stay in the city. We know you're at the Broken Wheel—we've known since you entered the capital. You're being watched. For your own safety, of course."

Of course.

Cassian stumbled out of the palace as evening fell. His head throbbed. The foreign memories pressed against his thoughts like unwelcome guests. Children he'd never met, love that belonged to someone else, all of it feeling thin and wrong.

He made it three blocks before he had to stop, leaning against a wall. The stolen memories wouldn't settle. Every time he tried to focus on one—to see a daughter's face clearly, to hear a son's voice—the details slipped away like water through his fingers. Not like forgetting. Like trying to remember something that had never been solid to begin with.

*Copies,* he realized with cold certainty. *These aren't real memories. They're echoes. Impressions.*

Draven had gotten to Corvan first. Not to recruit him—to prepare him. To plant false memories that would feel genuine enough to extract but wouldn't hold up under scrutiny. Everything Cassian had taken was a fabrication, carefully constructed to be believed.

Which meant the intelligence was false too. The northern force, the timing, all of it—designed to be extracted and acted upon.

Cassian's breath came short. He'd done exactly what Draven wanted. Proven his ability to the council, gained their trust, and delivered poisoned intelligence straight into their war planning.

But there was no way to know for certain. Not yet. The memories *felt* wrong, but that could just be his inexperience. The intelligence *seemed* solid. The scouts would verify or deny it by tomorrow.

Tomorrow.

If he was wrong—then he would be the man who delivered crucial intelligence that could save the city.

If he was right—if Draven had played him—then he'd just helped doom it.

He pushed off the wall, forcing himself to keep walking. Either way, there was nothing he could do about it now. The council was acting on the intelligence. The scouts were moving. Tomorrow would tell.

He'd won, hadn't he? He'd gained the King's attention, proven his value, secured his place in the court.

So why did it feel like he'd lost something far more important?

The city streets were quieter now, shops closing early. People retreated to their homes. Tomorrow—if Corvan's intelligence was accurate—the Hollow's forces would attack. If it wasn't accurate, if it was a trap, if Cassian had just helped spring whatever plan Draven had laid years in advance...

Cassian walked aimlessly, lost in thought, the coin heavy in his pocket. The stolen memories whispered. Children calling for a father who'd forgotten them. Love with blurred faces attached. Grief without clear substance.

"You look like hell."

Cassian's head snapped up. Mira stood near the palace steps, arms crossed, watching him with sharp concern.

"How long have you been waiting?" he managed.

"Long enough to hear the rumors coming out of that council chamber." Her expression was carefully neutral. "They're saying you did something impossible. That you ripped memories out of a traitor's mind." She paused. "Is it true?"

"I tried. I don't know if I succeeded or just made things worse." He looked at her, seeing the calculation behind her concern. "You waited for me. Why?"

She studied him for a long moment, then seemed to come to a decision. "Come on. You need food and somewhere to sit before you fall over. We can talk away from the palace."

They found a quiet corner at a street vendor's stall. Cassian sat heavily on a wooden bench, accepting the cup of hot cider she pressed into his hands. The warmth helped, grounding him.

"So," Mira said carefully, sitting beside him. "If you can extract memories from people... does that mean you could extract what the Hollow took from my brother?"

And there it was. The reason she'd waited.

"I don't know," Cassian said honestly. "What I did today—I barely understand how it worked, and I think I damaged him in the process. The memories I took are..." He struggled for words. "Wrong. Incomplete. Like trying to read a book where someone tore out pages at random."

Her face fell slightly. "So you can't help."

"I didn't say that." He met her eyes. "I'm learning. Every time I use this...technique...I learn more about how it works. And I did learn one useful thing today."

He told her about the northern force. Three thousand soldiers massing near the old aqueduct ruins. The newly converted being trained and organized. The attack planned for tomorrow night.

"If your brother was taken three weeks ago," Cassian said, "and if they're gathering the recent converts for this assault, there's a chance he's with that army. It's not certain, but it's the best lead I have."

Hope flared in her eyes. Dangerous, desperate hope. "You're certain about the location?"

"As certain as I can be, given the source. The intelligence could be false. Or corrupted. Or—" He stopped himself. "But it's something."

Mira was quiet for a moment, processing. Then: "What if we went? Tomorrow. Before the attack. While they're still staging. If I could see Torin, talk to him, maybe—"

"Maybe what?" Cassian asked gently. "He won't remember you. Won't feel anything about seeing you."

"I know. But at least I'd know he's alive. That there's still something to save." She turned to him, intense. "And you need to see them too, don't you? The newly converted. If you're going to figure out how to reverse what's been done to them, you need to study them up close."

She was right. The council chamber and secondhand reports weren't enough. If he was going to truly understand the Hollow—understand what he was fighting, what he might be becoming—he needed to see it firsthand.

"It's dangerous," he said. "If they catch us—"

"I know. But I've been chasing rumors for weeks. This is the closest I've come to really finding out where he is. I have to try." She looked at him. "Come with me. Please. I could use someone who knows hte enemy. And you could use your...gift."

Cassian thought about it. The King expected him to stay in the city, to be available. The palace was watching him. Leaving to chase Hollow forces right before an attack was insane.

But when had that stopped him?

And the foreign memories whispered in his mind—damaged, thin, possibly compromised. If he'd been played, if the intelligence was false, he needed answers before the attack came.

"Tomorrow," he said. "Before dawn. We go to the northern approach. But we're careful. We observe. We stay out of sight."

Mira's smile was wide and genuine for the first time since he'd known her. "Thank you. I'll meet you at the north gate. Two hours before dawn. Bring whatever you need to defend yourself."

She stood, shouldering her pack. Then paused. "Cassian? Whatever happened in that council chamber—whatever you think went wrong with that trade—don't let it consume you. I've seen what guilt does to people. How it eats them from the inside." Her eyes were sad. "My brother drowned in it before the Hollow ever touched him. Don't let it win."

Then she was gone, disappearing into the evening crowd.

Cassian sat alone with his cider, watching the city prepare for war. The stolen memories pressed at his thoughts. Somewhere in the city, Draven's forces were positioning themselves. Somewhere, another fragment waited to be found.

Tomorrow he'd search for Mira's brother. Tomorrow he'd try to verify the intelligence, to understand if he'd been played. Tomorrow he'd try to be better than he'd been today.

But tonight, he just sat at a vendor's stall as darkness fell, carrying memories of children he'd never met.

He started back toward the Broken Wheel as full dark settled over the city. The streets were nearly empty now, just a few late vendors packing up their wares. Cassian's thoughts churned—the trade, the memories, Mira's desperate hope, the attack coming tomorrow—

A deep horn sounded from the eastern walls.

Then another.

Then a third.

Cassian froze. That was the alarm. The call to arms. But the attack wasn't supposed to come until tomorrow night. Unless—

Fire bloomed along the eastern horizon. Not just one fire. Dozens. Orange flames climbing into the night sky, and from the walls came screams, chaos, the clash of steel on steel.

"No," Cassian breathed. "No, it's too early—"

People poured into the streets around him, panicked, running. Bells began ringing from churches throughout the city—the full alarm now, calling every able-bodied defender to the walls.

The intelligence was wrong. Or he'd gotten it wrong extracting it. Or—

*Or it was exactly what Draven intended you to receive.*

The northern force wasn't the primary attack. It was a feint. Corvan's memories, his guilt, his children—all of it carefully constructed. Given to him *to be extracted*. To misdirect. To make Cassian think he had crucial intelligence when all he really had was misdirection.

And Cassian had delivered it straight to the King's council.

More horns. The eastern gates were under assault. But Cassian could hear fighting from the south now too. From multiple directions. A coordinated strike while the defenders were still preparing for tomorrow's battle.

The city was burning.

And somewhere in the chaos, Cassian felt it: a pulse of warmth from the coin against his chest. Once. Twice. Three times.

Another fragment. Not just close now.

Moving. Getting closer with each pulse.

It wasn't just the Hollow attacking the city.

Draven was here.
