# Chapter 14: The Weight of Responsibility

The tavern was exactly where Draven's messenger said it would be.

Cassian crouched on a rooftop across the street, watching the building for any sign of movement. Three hours he'd been here, since before dawn. The promised emissary never appeared. No one entered or left except the occasional drunk stumbling home.

It was a trap. Obviously. The question was what kind.

Movement behind him. Cassian's hand went to the Coin of Heads before he recognized the footsteps.

"You're jumpy," Mira said, settling beside him on the roof's edge.

"You're late."

"I had to shake two of Aldric's guards. He's getting paranoid—thinks anyone who leaves the palace unannounced might be conspiring with Draven." She pulled her cloak tighter against the morning chill. "So? Are we going in?"

"No." Cassian stood, turning away from the tavern. "It's bait. And I'm not biting."

"You sure? Could be a real emissary down there. Someone waiting to be freed."

"Or it's an ambush. Or it's a test to see if I'm reckless enough to walk into obvious traps." Cassian started toward the roof's far edge, where a ladder led down to an alley. "Either way, I'm not the only person who matters in this war. If I die down there, Draven wins everything."

Mira followed him down the ladder. "That's what I wanted to talk to you about, actually. The 'dying' part."

"Cheerful topic."

"Strategic topic." They emerged into the alley, joining the flow of early morning workers heading to the markets. "You're carrying both coins. You're the only person who can use them. If Draven kills you—"

"The resistance loses its only weapons. I know." Cassian kept his voice low as they walked. "I've been thinking about that."

"And?"

"And I have some ideas. But not here." He glanced around at the growing crowd. "Somewhere we can talk without being overheard."

---

The healing ward was quiet at this hour. Torin sat by the window, practicing the mental exercises Cassian had taught him—trying to connect the warmth of morning sunlight to the memory of safety, safety to something resembling peace. His progress was slow but visible. Yesterday he'd linked three separate memories into a coherent narrative. Today he was attempting four.

"Torin," Cassian said, pulling up chairs for himself and Mira. "We need to talk. About the coins. About what happens if I die."

The young man turned his flat gaze to them. "You think you're going to die."

"I think it's likely. Eventually." Cassian pulled both coins from his pockets, setting them on the small table. "Draven's more experienced, better resourced, and he's been planning this for decades. I've been at this for weeks. The odds aren't good."

"So you want to prepare for succession," Torin said. "Pass the coins to someone before you're killed. Logical."

"Not exactly." Cassian picked up the Coin of Heads, feeling its familiar warmth. "My father passed his bond to me deliberately. It took time, preparation, understanding. If I die suddenly—violently—with no preparation, the coin might go dormant for years. Or bond to whoever's holding it, ready or not. That's not a succession plan. That's chaos."

Mira leaned forward. "So what's the solution?"

"I've been working on something. An alternative to transferring the bond." Cassian set down the Coin of Heads and picked up the Coin of Seeds. "Three days ago, I discovered I can delegate authority. Let someone use a coin's power without transferring my bond to it. Temporarily extend my access to others."

"How?" Torin asked, genuine interest flickering in his damaged awareness.

"Here. I'll show you." Cassian held out the Coin of Heads to Mira. "Touch it. But I'll keep contact too."

Mira hesitated, then placed her fingers on the coin alongside Cassian's. The metal warmed between them.

"Now focus," Cassian said, closing his eyes and entering his gray space. The threads of connection between him and the coin became visible—complex, layered, strong. And there, underneath, those dormant pathways he'd noticed before. The ones suggesting extension, delegation, shared authority.

He pulled on one carefully, feeding intent into it. *Let her see. Let her borrow what I've been granted. Temporary. Revocable. But real.*

The coin flared warm.

Mira gasped. "I can—Torin, I can see your thoughts. Not words, just... impressions. You're thinking about sunlight. About how it should feel warm but you can't quite remember what warm is supposed to mean." Her voice trembled with wonder. "It's like seeing inside your mind."

"That's the coin's perception," Cassian said. "Borrowed through me. As long as I maintain the connection, you can use the authority I've been granted. But it's still mine. If I let go—"

He withdrew the thread of delegation. Mira blinked, the enhanced vision fading.

"It's gone," she said. "Back to normal sight."

"Because the bond is still mine. You were just renting access." Cassian looked between them. "This is the answer. Not transferring the coins—teaching people to use them through me. Building a network where I'm not the only one who can act."

"But it still requires you," Torin observed. "You'd need to be present. Maintaining each connection. You'd still be the lynchpin—just with extensions."

"Yes. But that's better than fighting alone." Cassian picked up the Coin of Seeds. "And for the contingency plan—for if I actually die—I've been thinking about something different."

He turned to Torin, studying the young man's fragmented expression. "I want to lend you the Coin of Seeds. Not transfer the bond—just give you physical possession and authority to use it through me."

Torin's flat eyes showed a flicker of something. Confusion? Interest? "What's the difference?"

"The bond stays mine. The power stays mine. But you hold the coin, and I grant you permission to access what it can do. You could use it to heal yourself—grow new neural connections, repair what Draven broke. Help others recover from trauma. Cultivate plants for food or medicine." Cassian held up the Coin of Seeds. "It would be like Mira borrowing the Coin of Heads, except more permanent. You'd have it with you, able to use it whenever needed. But I'd still be the one bonded to it."

"So I'd be borrowing it. Long-term."

"Yes. With the understanding that if I'm dying—truly dying, no other option—I could transfer the bond to you then. Make it permanently yours. But not before." Cassian met his eyes. "Because I need both coins, Torin. I'm already outmatched. Draven has decades of experience, the Coin of Oxen, my father's coin, and an army. Giving away half my power when I'm already the underdog would be strategic suicide."

"But you'd trust me to hold it? Use it?"

"I'd trust you to try. Which isn't the same as full trust." Cassian's voice was gentle but honest. "You've chosen to reject Draven. That counts for something. But I don't actually know who you are yet. Your mind is still fragmented. Still rebuilding. The person you were before—the person you'll become after—I don't know them. You might be brave, selfless, reliable. Or you might be selfish, cowardly, power-hungry once you're whole again."

Mira stiffened. "Cassian—"

"He deserves honesty." Cassian kept his eyes on Torin. "I'm offering you enormous power and responsibility based on hope and limited evidence. That's not smart. But I'm willing to take the risk because I'm desperate and you need the coin's power to heal yourself. It's a calculated gamble, not blind faith."

Torin's expression didn't change—he still couldn't quite manage emotion—but something in his posture shifted. "You're saying you'll let me use it, but you'll be watching. Testing. Waiting to see who I really am."

"Yes."

"That's... fair." Torin looked at the Coin of Seeds on the table. "I don't know who I am either. What I'll become when the connections regrow. I hope I'll be someone worthy of this. But I can't promise that." He raised his eyes. "I can promise I'll try. That I'll use it to heal myself and others. That I won't betray you deliberately. Beyond that..." He trailed off.

"Beyond that, we'll find out together." Cassian picked up the Coin of Seeds. "Are you willing to accept it on those terms? Knowing I'm keeping the bond, keeping control, and you're essentially on probation?"

"Yes."

"Even though it means you won't have full autonomy? That I could revoke your access if I decided you were misusing it?"

"I have no autonomy now," Torin said simply. "My mind is broken. My emotions disconnected. I can barely remember what it feels like to want something. If you're offering me a tool that might help me become whole again—even with conditions—I'd be a fool to refuse."

Cassian stood, coming around the table. "Then we'll start today. I'll teach you what I know about growth—not just plants, but the principle itself. How to nurture rather than force. How to be patient with slow progress. How to accept that some things take time." He placed the Coin of Seeds in Torin's palm but kept his own hand in contact. "Feel that?"

"Warmth."

"That's the bond. Mine to you, through the coin." Cassian entered his gray space, opening one of those pathways of delegation. "I'm extending authority now. Lending you access. Try to sense what the coin perceives."

Torin's eyes widened—the most dramatic expression Cassian had seen from him. "I can feel... everything growing. The plants in the garden below. The mold between the wall stones. Even myself. I can sense where my mind should connect but doesn't. Like seeing gaps in a bridge."

"That's what you'll practice with. Every day, using the coin to examine your own consciousness. Finding places where new growth is possible. Nurturing those connections patiently." Cassian kept the delegation open, letting Torin acclimate to the sensation. "The coin won't fix you instantly. But it'll show you where to focus your effort. How to rebuild yourself piece by piece."

"How long will it take?"

"Months. Maybe years. Growth isn't fast." Cassian finally released the physical contact but left the delegation pathway open—a permanent thread connecting Torin to the coin's authority. "But you'll have the coin with you. And as long as I'm alive, you'll have the power to use it."

Torin stared at the coin in his hand. For the first time since restoration, something like hope flickered across his features. "Thank you."

"Use it well. And remember—I'll be evaluating how you use it. This is a trial period, not a permanent arrangement."

"Understood."

---

"That was smart," Mira said later, after Torin had left to practice in the garden. "Not giving him the full bond."

"It was necessary." Cassian felt the absence of the Coin of Seeds in his pocket, but not the absence of its power. The bond remained, strong as ever. "I can't afford to weaken myself right now. But I also can't fight alone. This is the compromise."

"He took it well. The lack of trust."

"Because he's not offended by pragmatism. His emotions are too damaged for that." Cassian looked out the window where Torin sat beneath a tree, holding the coin, eyes closed in concentration. "The question is who he'll be when those emotions return. Whether the person we're helping to rebuild will turn out to be someone we want to have power."

"You think he might betray us?"

"I think I don't know. And not knowing means staying vigilant." Cassian turned back to Mira. "Which brings me to you."

"Me?"

"I want to teach you to use the Coin of Heads. Really use it. Not just a single demonstration, but sustained access. So you can negotiate, perceive intentions, gather intelligence." He pulled out the coin. "You'd be my extension in places I can't go. Court functions with Aldric. Merchant meetings. Places where your presence is normal but mine would raise suspicion."

Mira looked at the coin, then at Cassian's face. "You'd trust me with that much access?"

"On probation. Same as Torin." Cassian's voice was level. "You betrayed me once. You've been working to make amends, and I appreciate that. But trust isn't rebuilt instantly. So yes, I'll give you access to the coin's power. And yes, I'll be watching how you use it."

"Fair enough." Mira extended her hand. "When do we start?"

"Now." Cassian placed the Coin of Heads in her palm, maintaining contact. "First lesson: perception without judgment. You're going to learn to see what people think without assuming you understand why they think it..."

---

Over the next several days, the team fell into a rhythm.

Cassian spent mornings with Torin, teaching him to use the Coin of Seeds for self-repair. The young man was a quick study despite his handicap. Each session, he managed to nurture one or two new neural connections—tiny threads of association where before there'd been only fragmentation. Yesterday he'd connected the smell of bread to a memory of his mother, and for a brief moment, actually felt something like warmth.

Afternoons were with Mira, training her to use the Coin of Heads' perception. She learned to sense surface thoughts, identify deception, gauge emotional states. Not as powerfully as Cassian—but skillfully enough to be genuinely useful in the field.

And evenings were spent looking for Perin.

The restored emissary was hiding somewhere in the city. Draven's forces had torn apart his workshop, sent hollow soldiers through the refugee quarters, offered bounties for information on his whereabouts. Which meant he was still alive, still free, and still a threat to whatever Draven was planning.

Finding him took patience and careful networking through Mira's contacts. But on the fourth evening of searching, Cassian finally got a lead—a grain merchant who'd seen a man matching Perin's description with a young girl, accessing his storage cellar at odd hours.

The cellar beneath the south market was cramped, dark, and reeked of mildew. But it was hidden—accessed through a false panel in a grain merchant's storeroom. Perin had his daughter with him. Elena, eight years old, thin but alive.

When Cassian descended the narrow stairs, the man grabbed a knife and stepped between his daughter and the door.

"Stay back," Perin warned, voice shaking. "I don't know who you are, but—"

"It's Cassian. I restored you. Remember?"

Perin squinted in the dim candlelight. Recognition flooded his face, followed by suspicion. "You. I heard you were dead. That Draven killed you the same night you freed me."

"Draven wanted you to think that. Wanted both of us uncertain." Cassian held up his hands, showing he was unarmed. "But here we both are. Alive. Which pisses him off."

Elena peeked around her father's legs. "Papa? Is this the man?"

"The man who gave me back my soul, yes." Perin's grip on the knife loosened slightly. "What do you want?"

"To offer you a choice." Cassian took a careful step forward. "First choice: take your daughter and run. I'll give you money, supplies, maps to safe houses beyond Draven's reach. You'll be free. Safe. Able to rebuild your life far from this war."

"And the second choice?"

"Stay. Join us. Teach me how the hollow network functions so I can break it systematically." Cassian met his eyes. "Help free others like you. Build something that can actually resist Draven. But know that if you stay, you'll be in danger. Draven's hunting you. That won't stop."

Perin looked at his daughter, then back at Cassian. "If I help you, I put her at risk."

"Yes."

"If I run, I keep her safe. For a while."

"Until Draven conquers the kingdom and there's nowhere left to run." Cassian's voice was quiet but firm. "I can't promise her safety if you stay. Can't promise you'll survive. All I can promise is that if we win—if we actually stop him—she'll grow up in a world where fathers don't get turned into hollow monsters. Where people don't have to choose between starvation and emptiness."

Elena tugged at her father's shirt. "Papa? I'm scared."

"I know, sweetheart." Perin's voice cracked. He knelt down, looking into her eyes. "That man who made me remember you—he's asking if we should help him fight the bad people. But it might be dangerous. We might get hurt."

"Will you get empty again if we don't help?"

"No. I'm whole now. That can't be undone."

"Then we should help." Elena's logic was childishly simple. "Because other people are empty. And that's sad. You were sad when you were empty. I want other people to not be sad."

Perin closed his eyes, a broken sound escaping his throat. Then he stood, facing Cassian. "If we do this—if we stay—you keep her away from the fighting. Hidden. Safe as you can manage."

"Agreed."

"And if things go wrong, if Draven finds us before you can stop him, you get her out. Even if I'm dead. Even if it costs you strategically. You save her first."

"I can't promise—"

"Then I run." Perin's voice was hard. "I won't risk her for principles. Won't sacrifice her for strategy. If you can't promise you'll prioritize her life over your war, then I take her and disappear right now."

Cassian felt the weight of the demand. It was unreasonable. Tactically stupid. A single child's life couldn't matter more than the resistance. Couldn't take priority over stopping Draven.

But looking at Perin's desperate eyes, at Elena's frightened face, Cassian knew what his answer had to be.

"All right. If it comes to it, I save her first. Even if it costs us."

"You mean that?"

"I do." And surprisingly, Cassian realized he did. Because what was the point of fighting to save humanity if he sacrificed his humanity to win? "But I need something in return."

"What?"

"Everything you know about the network. How tethers work. How information flows. How Draven controls emissaries from a distance. How the hierarchy functions." Cassian pulled out a folded map marked with hollow activity. "I've been tracking movements, but I don't understand the patterns. You will. You lived inside that system. You helped build it as an emissary. I need that knowledge."

Perin took the map, and something shifted in his demeanor. The terrified father receded slightly, replaced by the tactical mind of someone who'd spent two years as a hollow recruiter. He studied it with a carpenter's attention to detail, analyzing angles and positions like he once analyzed joints and grain.

"These territories overlap," he said, pointing. "See here? And here? That shouldn't happen. Each emissary has exclusive zones to prevent competition."

"So what does overlap mean?"

"Either territorial disputes—which Draven wouldn't allow, he's too controlling—or..." Perin's eyes widened. "Or they're preparing for something. Concentrating forces in specific areas."

"Preparing for what?"

"I don't know. But when I was hollow, we only consolidated like this before major operations. Mass recruitments. Enforcement actions against resistance cells." He looked up at Cassian. "Or attacks."

A chill ran down Cassian's spine. "Attacks on what?"

"Whatever Draven decides needs to be eliminated." Perin pointed at the densest cluster of marks. "This is near the palace district. Near where King Aldric holds court. If Draven's concentrating hollow soldiers there..."

"He's preparing to move against the king."

"Or against you. Everyone knows you're working with the palace. That you have Aldric's protection." Perin set down the map. "Either way, something's coming. Soon."

---

Cassian burst into the healing ward where Torin was practicing with the Coin of Seeds.

"We have a problem."

Torin looked up from the small plant he'd been nurturing—a failed crop seed he'd coaxed into sprouting through sheer patience. "What problem?"

"Draven's consolidating forces near the palace. Perin thinks it means an attack is coming." Cassian started pacing. "We're not ready. We have four people, two coins with limited delegation, and no idea when he'll strike."

"Then we prepare." Mira entered behind him, slightly out of breath. "I've been talking to my contacts in the palace guard. They're nervous too. Increased hollow sightings. Emissaries recruiting more aggressively. Some guards have already signed contracts."

"How many?"

"At least a dozen. Maybe more." Her face was grim. "They're infiltrating from inside. When Draven attacks, he'll have help from people already within the walls."

Cassian felt the situation spiraling. They weren't ready for this. Weren't strong enough, numerous enough, prepared enough. Four people couldn't stop an army.

Unless they didn't have to.

"What if we're thinking about this wrong?" Cassian stopped pacing. "We can't match Draven's numbers. Can't out-fight his forces. But we don't need to win militarily. We just need to break his network faster than he can attack."

"How?" Torin asked.

"By restoring his soldiers. Systematically. In large numbers." Cassian pulled out both coins. "With Perin, I discovered a method that works—but it requires two simultaneous trades and enormous concentration. If Draven's preparing a major move, I need to scale that method up. Hit a recruitment center. Free everyone at once."

"Two trades?" Mira asked. "What do you mean?"

Cassian held up the Coin of Heads. "First, I temporarily take their place in the network. Their tethers connect to me instead of them. That gives them a window of freedom where they're not bound to Draven. But it means I feel their hollowness. All of it. At once."

"How many people are we talking about?" Perin asked, concern evident.

"Twenty to thirty newly converted soldiers in the recruitment center I've been watching. Fresh converts—most hollowed within the last few weeks." Cassian set down the Coin of Heads and picked up the Coin of Seeds. "That's important. They haven't been drained much yet."

"Why does that matter?" Mira asked.

"Because it changes what's possible." Cassian looked at Torin. "When I freed you, you'd been hollow for three weeks. Draven had already drained some of your humanity—used it for his network. When I broke your tether, that humanity was *gone*. I couldn't restore what had already been consumed. That's why you're still fragmented."

Torin nodded slowly. "But Perin had been hollow for years. You restored him completely."

"Because he'd overpaid his contract massively. Years of service as an emissary gave him legal grounds to demand *everything* back from Draven's reservoir. The Law had to return what was taken." Cassian tapped the Coin of Seeds. "But these fresh converts? They haven't overpaid. They've barely started serving. They can't make the same legal argument Perin did."

"So they'd end up like me," Torin said. "Freed but broken."

"Maybe not." Cassian's voice gained intensity. "If they've only been hollow for days or weeks, Draven hasn't drained much from them yet. Most of their humanity is still there—just disconnected, not consumed. When I break the tethers, they'll be like you were: damaged, but not destroyed. Better than staying hollow. Not as good as full restoration, but functional."

Perin frowned. "That's your plan? Free them knowing they'll be broken?"

"That's my *fallback* plan." Cassian held up the Coin of Seeds. "First, I try something else. I help them argue that Draven's contracts are fraudulent—that he promised peace but delivered emptiness, making the entire agreement void. If the Law accepts that argument, their humanity gets returned just like yours did."

"And if the Law doesn't accept it?"

"Then I break the tethers anyway. They end up partially damaged, but free." Cassian met their eyes. "It's not perfect. But it's better than leaving them hollow while Draven marches on the palace."

Silence.

Then Torin spoke, his voice still flat but thoughtful. "The fraudulent contract argument is weak."

"I know."

"Draven has been doing this for decades. His contracts are carefully worded. The Law might not consider 'emptiness instead of peace' to be fraud—just interpretation."

"I know that too." Cassian set down both coins. "But I have to try. If even a few of them can make that argument successfully, they'll be fully restored. The rest..." He gestured to Torin. "They'll be like you. Broken but fixable. We can help them rebuild, the same way we're helping you."

"That's a lot of broken people to repair," Mira said quietly.

"Yes. But it's better than a lot of hollow people serving Draven." Cassian picked up the coins again. "And it proves the method works at scale. Next time, I'll know which arguments the Law accepts. Which timing works best. How to improve the process."

"You're treating this like an experiment," Perin observed.

"I'm treating it like war." Cassian's voice was hard. "Every battle teaches you something. Every victory—even a partial one—is progress. I'd rather free twenty people imperfectly than save zero people perfectly."

Torin's damaged face showed something that might have been approval. "Pragmatic."

"Desperate," Cassian corrected. "But you're right—I'm not going to let perfect be the enemy of good. These people signed contracts they didn't understand. Even if I can only partially restore them, that's better than leaving them in Draven's network."

"The mental strain will still be enormous," Perin warned. "Holding twenty or thirty tethers at once, even for a few seconds..."

"I know. But that's where Torin's insight helps." Cassian looked at the young man. "You said I should separate the actions. Hold the tethers just long enough for them to petition, then release immediately. That minimizes how long I'm connected to the network."

"It also means you can't guide their restorations individually," Torin pointed out. "If some of them get their humanity back and some don't, they'll all be going through different experiences at once. Some screaming from returned emotions, some confused by partial restoration, some still empty. Chaos."

"Then we manage the chaos." Cassian looked around at his small team. "Perin, you've been through restoration. You can help the ones who get their full humanity back deal with the flood of emotions. Torin, you understand what partial restoration feels like. You can help the ones who end up damaged. Mira handles security and evacuation. And I..." He gripped both coins. "I focus everything on the trades. On holding those tethers and giving them their chance."

"When would you try it?" Mira asked quietly.

"Tomorrow night. The recruitment center in the merchant district. I've been watching it for days—usually has twenty to thirty newly converted soldiers inside. Fresh tethers, not deeply embedded yet." Cassian's voice steadied as the plan took shape. "We hit it fast. I try the fraud argument first. If it works for some, great. For the rest, I break the tethers and accept they'll be partially damaged. We evacuate everyone who can walk and help those who can't."

"That's where the attack will be vulnerable," Perin said. "While you're focused on the trades, you'll be defenseless. If other hollow soldiers come—if emissaries respond—"

"Then we protect him," Mira said firmly. "That's what you built this team for, right? So you're not alone? So when you need to focus everything on the coins, the rest of us can handle the tactical problems?"

"Exactly." Cassian met her eyes, then Torin's, then Perin's. "I can't do this alone. But I'm not alone anymore. We're the Unhollow. The people who refuse emptiness. Tomorrow night, we prove it."

"The Unhollow," Perin tested the word. "I like it. Better than 'resistance' or 'rebels.' Says exactly what we are."

"Then it's decided." Cassian pocketed the Coin of Heads and looked at Torin holding the Coin of Seeds. "Tomorrow we find out if this delegation plan works in a real crisis. If we can combine the coins' powers. If we can free dozens of people without killing ourselves in the process."

"And if it doesn't work?" Mira asked.

"Then we'll have learned what not to do next time." Cassian's smile was grim. "Assuming there is a next time."

---

That night, Cassian lay awake considering the risks.

Twenty to thirty people. All being restored simultaneously. All reconnecting to their humanity at once while he merely provided the framework, the conditions, the space for it to happen. Torin's idea was theoretically sound—use the Coin of Heads to break the tethers, use the Coin of Seeds to enable natural restoration growth, let the people heal themselves instead of forcing it.

But theory and practice were different things.

If it failed, he could fragment dozens of minds beyond repair. Create permanent damage worse than the hollowing itself. Draven would use that failure as proof that restoration was cruel, that emptiness was mercy, that resistance meant suffering.

But if it worked...

If it worked, they'd have a method to free hollow soldiers en masse. A way to actually fight back against Draven's numbers. A path to winning this war that didn't require Cassian to bear impossible weight alone.

Tomorrow would tell.

One way or another, the Unhollow would prove themselves. Or break themselves trying.

Either way, it was better than doing nothing.

Cassian closed his eyes and tried to sleep, knowing rest wouldn't come easily. Tomorrow night, everything would change.

He just hoped it would change in the right direction.

---

Miles away, in his command tent, Draven Kane felt another subtle shift in his network. Not a severed tether this time—just a change in the pattern. His hollow soldiers consolidating as ordered. His emissaries preparing for the operation.

Tomorrow night, he'd strike at the palace. Remove King Aldric from power. Install his own people in the government. And when Cassian inevitably tried to stop him...

That's when Draven would spring his real trap.

Let the boy play hero. Let him exhaust himself trying to save the hollow soldiers Draven placed in his path—fresh converts, barely hollowed, easy targets that would make restoration seem achievable.

And while Cassian was busy being a savior, Draven's real forces would move. The deeply hollow ones. The lieutenants who'd been empty for decades. The ones carrying such weight that restoring them would break anyone who tried.

"Tomorrow, Rowan's son learns the truth," Draven murmured to the locket. "That mercy has a cost. That salvation requires sacrifice. And that sometimes, emptiness is the only rational response to an unbearable world."

The coin pulsed in its golden prison.

Draven smiled and closed his eyes.

Tomorrow, everything would change.

And Cassian would finally understand why the hollowing wasn't cruelty.

It was compassion.

The cruelest kind.
