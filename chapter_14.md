# Chapter 14: Seeds in Ash

The emissary stood near the fountain in the east market, watching the crowd with practiced patience. To anyone else, he looked like a kind middle-aged man taking in the morning air. But Cassian had been studying him for three days, and he knew better.

The man was hunting.

"There," Mira whispered beside him. "The woman with the crying baby."

Cassian nodded, already tracking her through the Coin of Heads. The young mother was at her breaking point—exhaustion written in every line of her body, desperation leaking from her like a scent the emissary could smell. The baby wouldn't stop screaming. The older child pulled at her skirts, demanding food. People were staring.

She looked ready to collapse.

The emissary moved with perfect, practiced timing.

He approached with a sympathetic smile, speaking words too quiet for Cassian to hear. But he could see the mother's expression shift from exhaustion to desperate hope. The emissary was offering something. Relief. Peace. Just sign here.

"We have to stop him," Mira started forward.

Cassian grabbed her arm. "Wait."

"But—"

"Watch."

The mother reached for the contract ledger, hand trembling. The emissary's smile widened. Then—at the last moment—she pulled back. Shook her head. Gathered her children and walked away quickly, as if afraid she'd change her mind.

The emissary's smile didn't waver. He simply turned, scanning the crowd for his next target.

"He'll just find someone else," Mira said.

"Not if I stop him first." Cassian started forward. "Stay close. If this goes wrong, run."

"What are you going to do?"

"Something I've been thinking about for days." Cassian's hand closed around the Coin of Heads in his pocket. "Something dangerous."

---

The idea had come to Cassian three nights ago, after another failed session with Torin in the healing ward.

He'd been studying the young man's fragmented mind through the Coin of Heads—seeing all those disconnected pieces floating like debris after a shipwreck. Memories without meaning. Sensations without connection. Everything there but nothing linked together.

The Coin of Heads had shown him something he'd missed before. When he looked at Torin's mind, then looked at his own, the difference wasn't in the *pieces* but in the *pattern*. Cassian's thoughts connected naturally—memory to emotion, sensation to meaning, cause to effect. Torin's didn't.

But what if that pattern could be *shown*? Not imposed, but demonstrated?

What if Cassian could let Torin borrow his mind's structure—just for a moment—long enough to see what wholeness looked like?

He'd spent two days considering the risks. The Coin of Heads granted him authority over the realm of mind—that much was becoming clearer with each use. It let him see mental structures, perceive thoughts, understand how consciousness worked. But could it let him *share* that structure?

Could he build a bridge?

The danger was obvious. Connecting his mind to Torin's fragmented consciousness could destabilize both of them. Cassian's wholeness might drain into Torin's emptiness like water seeking level. Or worse—Torin's brokenness might infect Cassian's intact pathways, fragmenting him too.

But Cassian's mind had grown stronger these past weeks. Every time he used the Coin of Heads, every mental exercise, every problem he solved—all of it had been building his mental fortitude. Not through trades or tricks, but through practice. Like strengthening a muscle.

If his mind was strong enough, he might be able to withstand the contact.

Might.

He'd tried it once, this morning. Very carefully. Very briefly.

It had worked.

For just a moment, Torin had felt what it was like to have his thoughts connected. The tea made him feel comfortable, safe. Feeling comfortable made him feel cared for, being cared for linking to his mother's memory. Everything flowing together naturally, the way it should.

Then Cassian had withdrawn, and Torin had slumped forward, gasping—but with something approaching *wonder* in his empty eyes.

"That was..." Torin had whispered. "I *felt* something."

Now, watching the emissary hunt for victims in the marketplace, Cassian wondered: if the technique worked on Torin, could it work on someone who was hollow?

Could he show an emissary what they'd lost?

There was only one way to find out.

---

Cassian walked straight up to the emissary and grabbed his arm.

The man jerked back, startled. "What—"

"I know what you are." Cassian's voice was low, urgent. "And I know what you used to be."

The emissary's eyes narrowed. Around them, the market crowd flowed past, oblivious. "Let go of me."

"Your name is Perin. You were a carpenter. You had a daughter—Elena. Eight years old, brown hair, crooked front tooth." Cassian tightened his grip as the emissary tried to pull away. "You loved her so much it hurt. Then you couldn't feed her. Couldn't keep her safe. So you signed a contract with Draven Kane, and he took that love away. Made you empty so you wouldn't feel the pain of failing her."

The emissary went very still. "How do you—"

"I can see it. Your memories. Scattered but still there." Cassian pulled out the Coin of Heads. "And I can show you. Make you remember what you traded away. Would you let me try?"

"No." The word was flat, reflexive. "I don't want to remember."

"Your daughter is still out there. Still waiting for you."

"I don't *have* a daughter anymore. I'm—" The emissary's voice cracked slightly. "I'm nothing. Empty. That's the peace I bought."

"That's the lie Draven sold you." Cassian could see the hollow shimmer around the man through the coin—smooth, reflective, but with cracks. Fragments of personality left intact so you would seem more human to your victims. "Your master left enough of you behind to be useful. That means you have some humanity left in you."

Around them, people were starting to stare. The emissary glanced nervously at the crowd. "If I call out, six more emissaries will be here in minutes. You can't fight us all."

"I'm not here to fight." Cassian met his eyes. "I'm here to make you an offer. Let me show you what you lost. Just for a moment. If you still want the emptiness after that, I'll walk away."

"And if I refuse?"

"Then I'll follow you. Stop you from recruiting. Warn every desperate person you approach." Cassian's voice was hard. "You'll be useless to Draven. And you know what he does with useless tools."

The emissary's jaw tightened. Fear flickered across his hollow features—not for himself, but fear of losing his purpose, his only remaining anchor. "You're cruel."

"Yes. But not as cruel as leaving you hollow while your daughter begs for bread in the refugee quarter."

The emissary flinched. That image still hurt him—not the way it should, not with a father's love, but like a distant ache. Proof that fragments remained.

"One moment," Cassian said quietly. "Let me show you what you lost. Then the choice is yours."

The emissary looked at the coin, then at Cassian's face, then at the crowd flowing past. Desperate people everywhere. People he'd recruited. People he'd helped hollow.

"One moment," he agreed finally. "Then you leave me alone."

Cassian nodded. Then, very carefully, he entered his gray space.

From here, he could see the emissary's consciousness more clearly. Not shattered like Torin's, but *hollowed*—carved out deliberately, systematically. The structure remained, but the contents had been drained away through a tether connecting him to Draven's network. A pulsing thread of stolen humanity, feeding his essence into that vast reservoir.

And scattered in the hollow spaces, fragments. Memories Draven hadn't bothered to erase because they weren't painful enough to matter. A daughter's laugh. The smell of fresh-cut wood. The pride of building something with his own hands.

Cassian reached out with the Coin of Heads, creating a bridge between his mind and the emissary's hollow consciousness. He connected them carefully, letting the man feel what Cassian felt—the weight of caring, the warmth of memory, the complexity of being fully human.

The emissary gasped as sensation flooded back. Not his own memories yet, but the *experience* of having them. Through Cassian's mind, he could perceive what he'd lost.

"Do you feel that?" Cassian asked quietly in the grey space. "That's what you traded away. That's what Draven took from you."

"It hurts," the emissary whispered. "Everything hurts—"

"Yes. But look deeper. What else do you feel?"

Through the connection, the emissary could sense his own scattered memories—still there, still his, just disconnected from the tether. His daughter's laugh. The pride when she learned her letters. The desperate love that had driven him to sign Draven's contract in the first place.

"Elena." The word came out broken. "I remember—she's real. She's *real* and I abandoned her—"

"She's waiting for you," Cassian said. "Still alive. Still hoping you'll come back. But you can't reach her while you're hollow. While Draven holds what you traded away."

The emissary could see it now through Cassian's perception—the tether connecting him to the network, feeding his humanity into Draven's reservoir. His love for his daughter, his grief, his shame, his hope—all of it flowing away, keeping him empty.

"I was deceived," the emissary said, horror dawning in his voice. "He said—Draven said I'd have peace. That I wouldn't suffer anymore. But this isn't peace. It's *nothing*. I feel nothing. I *am* nothing."

"You can take it back," Cassian said. "But first, I need to explain something about the contract you signed."

Through their connection, Cassian showed the emissary his own memory of that day—the contract Draven offered, black ink on yellowed paper, elegant script promising relief from suffering in exchange for "service of equivalent value" and "compensation deemed appropriate by the benefactor."

The emissary stared at the memory. "I remember signing it. I remember thinking it was fair."

"Look at the terms again. Really look." Cassian guided his attention to the specific phrases. "'Service of equivalent value'—did Draven ever tell you what that service would be? How long it would last?"

"No. He just said... I'd serve. Until the debt was paid."

"And 'compensation deemed appropriate by the benefactor'—did he tell you what he considered appropriate?"

The emissary's hollow eyes narrowed. "He said... peace. Relief from grief."

"Peace." Cassian let the word hang between them. "And what did you actually get?"

"Nothing. I feel... nothing."

"Exactly. Not peace. Emptiness. Those aren't the same thing." Cassian's voice grew intense. "You signed a contract promising peace in exchange for service. But he gave you emptiness—which is worthless—and he's made you serve for *years*. You've been recruiting people, converting hundreds of souls to his network. That's not 'service of equivalent value.' That's slavery."

Through the connection, the emissary could see it now. The contract's vagueness. The way Draven had interpreted every ambiguous phrase to his own advantage. The massive imbalance between what was promised and what was delivered.

"I was cheated," the emissary whispered.

"Yes. And because the terms were never clearly defined, you have the right to challenge them. To demand fair compensation." Cassian pulled out a second object—another coin, different from the first. Warmer. "As an emissary, you know how the Law of Balance works, right? Every trade must be fair. Equal value exchanged."

"Yes. That's what we tell people when they sign."

"Then you understand: if you've given far more than you received, you're owed the difference. It's basic accounting." Cassian's ledger-keeper instincts came through clearly. "You agreed to temporary service for peace. Instead, you've given years of work for nothing. The Law itself will recognize that imbalance—if you petition correctly."

"Petition? How?"

"Here's what's going to happen." Cassian spoke slowly, making sure the emissary understood. "I'm going to make an offer to the Law—to take your place temporarily. You know the connection you feel? The one binding you to Draven's network?"

"The... yes. The pull. Like something's always draining me."

"That's your tether. What Draven uses to keep you hollow." Cassian met his eyes. "I'm going to take that connection onto myself. Just for a short time. That means *I'll* feel the emptiness instead of you. It'll hurt me, but it'll free you. For just a few minutes, you won't be bound to him anymore."

The emissary's breath quickened. "And then?"

"Then you make your own offer to the Law. While you're free, you say: 'I've served for years beyond what my contract required. I've recruited hundreds of people. That service is worth far more than temporary peace—which I never received anyway. I demand compensation. I want my humanity returned.'"

"My... humanity?"

"Everything Draven took from you." Cassian showed him through their connection—the love for Elena, the pride in his work, the capacity to care. "It's not gone. It's being held somewhere. Stored. And if you've overpaid your contract—which you absolutely have—the Law *has* to give it back to you. That's how balance works."

The emissary was quiet for a long moment. Through the connection, Cassian could feel him weighing the choice. The safety of emptiness versus the pain of being human again. The certainty of nothing versus the risk of everything.

Finally: "What do I need to do?"

"When I take your burden, you'll feel the connection release. You'll have a few minutes—maybe less—where you're completely free. Use that time to speak to the Law. Out loud or in your mind, doesn't matter. Tell it you've overpaid. Tell it you demand your humanity back as compensation. Be specific: your love for your daughter, your memories, your ability to feel. Everything Draven took. Understood?"

"Understood."

"The Law will evaluate your claim. If it agrees you've overpaid—and you absolutely have—it'll grant your petition. Your humanity will return." Cassian gripped both coins tightly. "When that happens, don't fight it. Let it in. Let yourself feel again, even though it hurts. Trust me. Can you do that?"

The emissary looked at his hands—hollow, empty, capable of terrible things in Draven's service. Then he looked at Cassian's face, seeing genuine conviction there.

"Yes," he said. "I trust you."

"Then we start now." Cassian closed his eyes, entering the gray space fully. "Remember: when you feel the connection release, petition immediately. You won't have much time before I have to let go."

The emissary nodded, preparing himself.

Cassian reached out to the Law itself, speaking clearly: "I offer to take this man's burden temporarily. His connection to Draven's network—I'll hold it in his place. In exchange, release him from that binding. Just for a few minutes. Let him be free to speak on his own behalf."

The Law considered. It was a fair offer. A burden for a burden, temporary but genuine.

It accepted.

The tether shifted from the emissary to Cassian.

Emptiness flooded in like ice water. Cassian felt the connection to Draven's network wrap around his essence, binding him to that vast reservoir. Felt the pull trying to drain him, to make him hollow. His emotions began to flatten. His thoughts began to scatter.

*Hold on,* he told himself desperately. *Just hold on.*

In the real world, the emissary gasped. For the first time in years, he felt the tether release. The constant draining stopped. He was free.

"Now!" Cassian managed through gritted teeth. "Petition now!"

The emissary didn't need to enter any gray space—Cassian was doing that for him. He just needed to speak. To make his case to the Law that governed all exchanges.

"I signed a contract," the emissary said, his voice gaining strength as he spoke. "Draven Kane promised me peace in exchange for service of equivalent value. But I got nothing—no peace, just emptiness. And I've given him *years*. I've recruited hundreds of people. I've served his network. That wasn't in my contract. That's not equivalent service—I've overpaid."

The Law listened.

"I demand what's owed to me," the emissary continued. "I've paid far more than my contract required. I want compensation. I want my humanity back—everything that was taken. My love for my daughter. My memories. My ability to feel. Everything Draven holds that's mine. That's fair. That's balanced. I've earned it."

In the gray space, Cassian felt the Law evaluating the claim. Checking the contract's vague language. Weighing years of service as an emissary against the promised "relief from suffering" that had never truly been delivered.

The balance was not even close.

The emissary had overpaid.

Drastically.

The Law ruled in his favor.

From Draven's reservoir, everything that had been drained away—the emissary's love, his grief, his memories, his capacity to care—came rushing back like a dam breaking. But Cassian was ready. Even as the hollowness tried to overwhelm him, he channeled the returning humanity through his second coin.

Cassian could barely hold it—maintaining the tether with one coin while the other facilitated restoration, all while the network tried to hollow him out. His vision grayed. His thoughts began to blur. For a terrifying moment, he felt himself fragmenting, becoming nothing—

Then he released the tether.

The connection snapped back toward Perin, but found nowhere to attach. Perin was whole now, his humanity restored and growing. The tether couldn't reconnect to someone who was complete. It scattered into fragments, dissipating into the gray space.

Gone.

Cassian collapsed back into his own mind, gasping. Both coins burned in his palms—the Coin of Heads keeping his thoughts coherent despite the exhaustion, the Coin of Seeds still humming with residual growth energy.

Through the network, Cassian felt Draven's awareness snap toward them—surprise, then cold understanding. But by then it was too late. Both trades were complete. The Law had sided with Perin.

Cassian waited, bracing himself. Last time—when he'd freed Torin—he'd only had one coin. He'd taken Torin's place temporarily, given him a window of freedom, but had no way to restore what had already been drained away. Torin had been able to break the tether through resistance, but the damage was already done. Weeks of being hollow had depleted his humanity, and Cassian had no way to return it.

But this time was different. This time, Cassian had both coins. The Coin of Heads to hold the tether away from the hollow's mind. The Coin of Seeds to broker a trade for restoration. And Perin himself had been hollow long enough to have *overpaid* his contract substantially—giving him the legal argument to demand a full refund.

Two trades. Two coins. Both necessary.

And the trades were elegant. Balanced. Fair.

The Law couldn't deny them.

Cassian sensed no death in the network. No compensation required elsewhere. Just Perin, gasping and whole, and Cassian exhausted but intact.

The difference was simple: Torin's contract was still technically active when Cassian freed him. The Law had no grounds to return what Draven had taken because the agreement was still in force. Perin's contract, however, had been fulfilled beyond its terms. The Law *had* to return what was owed.

One method scattered the tether through resistance. The other nullified the contract through legal argument.

Both freed the person. But only one restored them completely.

No time to wonder. Carefully, painfully, Cassian withdrew.

They both collapsed in the real world.

Cassian hit the cobblestones hard, gasping. His chest felt like it was being crushed. Every breath was agony. Mira was at his side instantly, hands on her shoulders.

"Cassian! Are you—"

"I'm fine," he managed. "Just... exhausted. Help him."

Perin was on his knees nearby, tears streaming down his face. But his eyes—his eyes were clear. Filled with pain and joy and guilt and hope all mixed together. But *filled*. Human.

"Elena," he whispered. Then louder, desperate: "Elena! Where is she? I have to—I have to find her—"

"South market," Cassian said, still struggling to breathe. "Refugee quarter. I saw her in your memories. She's been surviving by begging."

Perin covered his face, sobbing. "I abandoned her. For *peace*. What kind of father—"

"The kind who was deceived." Cassian forced himself to sit up, ignoring the way his vision swam. "Draven promised you peace. He gave you emptiness. That wasn't a fair trade. That's why you were able to reclaim what was yours."

Perin looked up, eyes red but focused. "Will it last? Or will I slip back into—"

"You chose to take back your humanity. That choice can't be undone unless you willingly sign another contract with Draven. And knowing what you know now..." Cassian met his eyes. "Would you ever make that trade again?"

"Never." The word was fierce, absolute. "I'd die first. I'd let Elena watch me starve before I became that hollow thing again."

"Then you're free of him." Cassian pressed a small pouch of coins into his hand. "Take this. Get your daughter. Leave the city if you can. Draven will come for you when he realizes what happened."

Perin stared at the coins. "You're not keeping me here? Using me as a weapon?"

"No. I'm giving you back your life. What you do with it is your choice." Cassian met his eyes. "Though if you want to help fight Draven, I won't stop you. Just know that it'll cost you. Maybe everything."

Perin nodded slowly. "What's your name? I should know the name of the man who saved me."

"Cassian."

"Thank you, Cassian." Perin stood on shaky legs. "I was—my name is Perin. Carpenter. Father. I'd forgotten." He looked at his hands like they were foreign objects. "I'd forgotten I had a name that wasn't 'emissary.'"

Cassian lifted his hand and placed it on the man's shoulder. "You're Perin again. Remember that."

Perin nodded and stumbled away into the crowd, heading south toward where his daughter waited.

Cassian watched him go, then closed his eyes, reaching out with his senses. Trying to feel if the network had compensated. If someone had died.

He couldn't tell. When he'd freed Torin, he'd felt the weight of a life winking out. The woman dragged in by the guards, nose bleeding, confirmed this. But had that been real? Or had Draven made it seem real, planting the sensation to discourage future restorations?

Now, with Perin freed, Cassian felt... nothing. Just exhaustion. Just the weight of what he'd carried.

The uncertainty gnawed at him.

"That was incredible," Mira breathed, watching Perin depart. "You actually did it."

"Once." Cassian wiped sweat from his brow. "I did it once. And it took everything I had in me."

They sat in silence for a moment. Then Mira asked: "Can you do it again?"

Cassian tested his mental strength, feeling the exhaustion settling into his bones. "Yes. But not today. Maybe not tomorrow. Bearing that weight... it took everything I had." He looked at the crowd flowing past. "But the method works. And every day I delay, more people sign contracts they don't understand."

"So you'll rest, then try again."

"Yes." Cassian forced himself to stand, swaying slightly. "And again. Until either Draven stops me or I've restored every single one of his recruiters."

Mira helped steady him. "You look terrible."

"I feel worse." Cassian managed a grim smile. "But I'll recover. I just need—"

His vision grayed at the edges. The world tilted.

Mira caught him before he hit the ground.

---

Perin ran.

His legs trembled with each step, muscles unused to the urgency of purpose. Two years of hollow emptiness had taught him efficient movement—never hurried, never desperate, never *caring* enough to run. But now every fiber of his being screamed to move faster.

Elena. His daughter. Six years old—no, eight now. Two years lost. Two years of her growing up without him, thinking he'd abandoned her by choice.

The south market refugee quarter sprawled in the shadow of the old city walls—a warren of makeshift shelters and desperate people. Perin's newly restored memories showed him exactly where to look. The alley behind the baker's shop. Elena had claimed the space under the external staircase, where the overhang kept the rain off and the baker sometimes left day-old bread.

He rounded the corner and stopped.

There.

A girl sat hunched against the wall, knees drawn to her chest, dark hair matted and tangled. Too thin. Clothes patched and repatched. But alive. When she looked up at his footsteps, he saw the crooked front tooth—the one she'd chipped falling from a tree three years ago while he'd been teaching her to climb.

Elena's eyes widened. She scrambled to her feet, backing against the wall. "I didn't steal nothing! The bread was left out, I thought—"

"Elena." The name broke on his lips.

She froze. Stared at him. Her face went through a dozen emotions—confusion, recognition, disbelief, and then something that made Perin's heart shatter.

Hope.

"Papa?" Her voice was so small. So uncertain. "Is it... is it really you?"

Perin couldn't speak. Could only nod as tears streamed down his face—tears he hadn't been able to cry for two years, emotions he'd traded away coming back in a flood that threatened to drown him.

Elena took one hesitant step forward. Then another. Then she was running, crashing into him, small arms wrapping around his waist as she sobbed into his chest.

"You came back," she gasped between sobs. "You came back, you came back, I knew you would, Mama said you were dead but I *knew*—"

"I'm sorry." Perin sank to his knees, clutching her tight, feeling every rib through her threadbare shirt. "Elena, I'm so sorry. I left you. I abandoned you. I—"

"You're here now." She pulled back just enough to look at his face, her small hands grabbing his cheeks. "Your eyes are different. They're... you're *here*. You can see me again."

He hadn't realized how hollow his gaze must have been before. How empty. But Elena had noticed. Of course she had. Children always saw what adults tried to hide.

"I was sick," Perin said, the words tumbling out. "Something bad happened to me. I made a terrible mistake, and it took me away from you. But I'm better now. I'm me again."

"The hollow sickness?" Elena's voice dropped to a whisper. "Like the soldiers? Mama said—before she died—she said maybe that's what happened to you."

Perin's throat closed. "Your mother..."

"Three months ago. The fever." Elena said it with the matter-of-fact tone of a child who'd seen too much death. "She told me to be brave. To stay alive until you came back. Because you would come back."

"I'm here." Perin pulled her close again, breathing in the smell of her hair beneath the grime. "I'm here, and I'm never leaving you again. Never. I don't care what it costs."

They stayed like that for a long moment, just holding each other. Then Elena pulled back, wiping her eyes with dirty hands.

"Are you really better? Or will you go empty again?"

The question cut through him. But she deserved honesty. "A man helped me. Freed me from the sickness. He says it won't come back unless I choose it. And I will *never* choose it again. Not for anything."

Elena was quiet for a moment, her small fingers tracing the lines on his face—lines that hadn't been there before. Lines carved by two years of emptiness. "What was it like? Being hollow?"

"Like drowning," Perin whispered. "But not caring that you couldn't breathe. I knew you existed. I could remember facts about you—your name, your age. But I couldn't remember *caring* about you. Couldn't feel the love. It was like watching my own life through a stranger's eyes."

"That sounds horrible."

"It was a mercy," Perin said bitterly. "That's what I thought when I signed the contract. That forgetting how much I loved you would be easier than watching you starve because I couldn't provide for you. I thought emptiness would hurt less than failing you every single day."

"But you're back now." Elena's voice was fierce, protective. "You're here and you remember and you won't leave again."

"Never." Perin pulled her close, feeling her heartbeat against his chest—real, alive, *his daughter*. "I swear it on everything I am. I will never leave you again."

She burrowed into him, and he felt her body shaking with sobs she'd been holding back. "I missed you so much, Papa. Every day. Even when Mama said you might not come back. Even when the other children said you'd abandoned us. I knew—I *knew*—that if you could, you would come home."

"You were right." Perin's voice broke. "I wanted to come home every second of those two years. But I couldn't. The man who helped me—he gave me back my will. My choice. Myself."

Elena pulled back to look at him, tears streaking clean lines through the dirt on her face. "I want to thank him. Can we? Please? I need to tell him what he gave back to me."

Perin thought of Cassian collapsed in the marketplace, Mira catching him before he hit the ground. The exhaustion in his eyes. The way he'd pressed coins into Perin's hands and told him to run, to live, to be free.

"Someday," Perin said softly. "When it's safe. When I can look him in the eyes without falling apart from gratitude. But right now, we need to get you fed and somewhere safe. That's what he'd want. For us to live."

Elena nodded, but her hand tightened in his. "I'll never forget what he did. Never."

"Neither will I." Perin stood, pulling Elena up with him. His voice was thick. "He gave me my life back. Gave me *you* back. I don't know how to repay a debt like that. I don't even know where to start."

"Then we'll figure it out together," Elena said simply. "When we're ready."

"Together," Perin repeated, the word feeling sacred on his tongue. He squeezed her hand. "Come on. Let's find you some real food. And a bath. And maybe some clothes that aren't held together by hope and thread."

Elena managed a small laugh—the sound like sunlight breaking through clouds. "Do we have money for all that?"

Perin showed her the small pouch Cassian had given him. "Enough to start. We'll figure out the rest."

They walked out of the alley together, Perin's carpenter's hands—too long empty of purpose—now wrapped protectively around his daughter's.

Behind them, the shelter under the stairs stood abandoned.

Elena wouldn't need it anymore.

She had her father back.

---

Cassian woke in the healing ward with Torin staring at him.

"You overextended yourself," the young man observed. "Your body couldn't sustain the mental exertion."

"Thanks for the diagnosis." Cassian's voice was hoarse. He tried to sit up and immediately regretted it. "How long was I out?"

"Six hours. My sister brought you in. She said you collapsed after restoring an emissary." Torin's voice was flat, but there was something like concern underneath it. Or maybe Cassian was imagining it. "Did it work?"

"She said you made the man better."

Cassian blinked, still trying to wake his weary body. But he was glad to hear the good news.

"Good." He said. "The first of many."

"You can free more of them?" Torin inquired.

"Once I've recovered, yes."

"How long will that take?"

"A day. Maybe two. My mind needs time to... recharge. Get its strength back." Cassian looked at Torin. "In the meantime, I should probably continue your restoration. Get you back to functional while I'm resting."

"I'd appreciate that." Torin handed him a cup of tea. "I've been practicing what you showed me. Trying to connect the tea smell to being safe at home. It's... difficult. Like trying to remember a language I used to speak fluently but forgot."

"That's a good analogy." Cassian took the cup, sipping carefully. "Your mind is relearning how to make connections. It'll get easier with practice."

"How much practice?"

"We don't know." Cassian set down the cup. "There's no shortcut for this kind of healing. No trade that'll just fix you instantly. Just slow, patient work."

Torin nodded slowly. "Then we should continue. I don't want to waste time."

Despite the exhaustion—Cassian smiled. There it was again. That flicker of who Torin had been. Brilliant, driven, impatient with inefficiency.

Not gone. Just buried. Waiting to grow back.

"All right," Cassian said. "Let's practice."

Two days later, after rest and recovery, Cassian sat with Torin and Mira in the healing ward.

"We need to talk about what comes next," he said, setting both coins on the small table between them. "Perin's restoration worked, but it took everything I had. If Draven sends multiple emissaries at once—or if I need to act while I'm still recovering—I'll fail."

"So what's the solution?" Mira asked.

"Delegation." Cassian picked up the Coin of Heads. "I've been studying the bond between me and the coins. There are pathways I haven't explored yet. Threads suggesting I can extend authority without transferring the bond itself."

Torin leaned forward, showing the first real interest Cassian had seen from him in days. "You mean let others use the coins' power?"

"Temporarily. With my permission. Through me." Cassian held out the Coin of Heads to Mira. "Touch it. Keep contact while I maintain mine."

Mira hesitated, then placed her fingers on the coin alongside Cassian's. The metal warmed between them.

Cassian closed his eyes, entering his gray space. The threads of connection between him and the coin became visible—complex, layered, strong. And there, underneath, those dormant pathways he'd noticed before. The ones suggesting extension, delegation, shared authority.

He pulled on one carefully, feeding intent into it. *Let her see. Let her borrow what I've been granted. Temporary. Revocable. But real.*

The coin flared warm.

Mira gasped. "I can—Torin, I can see your thoughts. Not words, just... impressions. You're thinking about sunlight. About how it should feel warm but you can't quite remember what warm is supposed to mean." Her voice trembled with wonder. "It's like seeing inside your mind."

"That's the coin's perception," Cassian said. "Borrowed through me. As long as I maintain the connection, you can use the authority I've been granted. But it's still mine. If I let go—"

He withdrew the thread of delegation. Mira blinked, the enhanced vision fading.

"It's gone," she said. "Back to normal sight."

"Because the bond is still mine. You were just renting access." Cassian looked between them. "This is important. I can't be everywhere at once. Can't handle every situation alone. But if I can teach you both to use the coins through me—extend my reach without weakening my bond—we become something more than just three people working separately."

"We become a team," Mira said quietly.

"We become the people who refuse to stay hollow," Cassian corrected. "The ones who choose wholeness over emptiness. Even when it's harder. Even when it hurts." He picked up the Coin of Seeds. "Torin, I want you to hold this one. Use it to heal yourself—grow new neural connections, repair what Draven broke. But the bond stays mine. You'd be borrowing it long-term."

Torin's flat eyes showed a flicker of something. "You'd trust me with that much power?"

"On probation," Cassian said honestly. "You've rejected Draven. That counts for something. But your mind is still fragmented. I don't actually know who you are yet—who you'll become when you're whole again. So yes, I'll give you access. And yes, I'll be watching how you use it."

"That's... fair." Torin looked at the Coin of Seeds. "I don't know who I am either. What I'll become when the connections regrow. I can promise I'll try to use it well. Beyond that..." He trailed off.

"Beyond that, we'll find out together." Cassian placed the Coin of Seeds in Torin's palm but kept his own hand in contact. "Feel that?"

"Warmth."

"That's the bond. Mine to you, through the coin." Cassian entered his gray space, opening one of those pathways of delegation. "I'm extending authority now. Try to sense what the coin perceives."

Torin's eyes widened—the most dramatic expression Cassian had seen from him. "I can feel... everything growing. The plants in the garden below. Even myself. I can sense where my mind should connect but doesn't. Like seeing gaps in a bridge."

"That's what you'll practice with. Every day, using the coin to examine your own consciousness. Finding places where new growth is possible." Cassian kept the delegation open, letting Torin acclimate. "The coin won't fix you instantly. But it'll show you where to focus."

"How long will it take?"

"Months. Maybe years. Growth isn't fast." Cassian finally released physical contact but left the delegation pathway open—a permanent thread connecting Torin to the coin's authority. "But you'll have the coin with you. And as long as I'm alive, you'll have the power to use it."

Torin stared at the coin in his hand. For the first time since restoration, something like hope flickered across his features. "Thank you."

"Use it well." Cassian turned to Mira. "And you—I want to train you with the Coin of Heads. Teach you to perceive intentions, spot deception, gather intelligence. You can go places I can't—court functions with Aldric, merchant meetings. Places where your presence is normal but mine would raise suspicion."

Mira extended her hand. "When do we start?"

"Now." Cassian placed the Coin of Heads in her palm, maintaining contact. "First lesson: perception without judgment. You're going to learn to see what people think without assuming you understand why..."

They spent the next several hours practicing. Mira learned to sense surface thoughts, identify emotional states, gauge sincerity. Not as powerfully as Cassian—but skillfully enough to be useful.

By evening, they'd established something new. Not just Cassian fighting alone with magical coins, but three people working together. A team with complementary strengths.

"We need a name," Mira said as they finished. "Something that says what we are."

"The resistance?" Torin suggested flatly.

"Too generic." Cassian thought for a moment. "We're the people who refuse emptiness. Who choose to be whole even when it's painful. We're..." He paused, the word forming. "The Unhollow."

Mira tested it. "The Unhollow. I like it. Says exactly what we stand against."

"And what we stand for," Torin added, surprising them both with the insight. "Not just opposing Draven. Choosing humanity over convenience."

"The Unhollow it is," Cassian said. He looked at his two teammates—damaged but willing, inexperienced but learning. Not the army he'd hoped for. But enough to start with.

Enough to matter.

Over the following days, the Unhollow fell into their rhythm.

Cassian spent mornings looking for Perin, worried Draven would retaliate against the freed emissary. Mira's contacts finally tracked him to a grain merchant's cellar—hiding with his daughter, alive and whole. The relief Cassian felt confirmed what he already knew: this work mattered. Every person freed was a victory, no matter how small.

Afternoons were for training. Mira practiced using the Coin of Heads' perception. Torin worked with the Coin of Seeds, slowly nurturing new connections in his damaged mind. Each day brought small improvements. Each session revealed new possibilities for what delegation could achieve.

And evenings, Cassian studied the patterns. Draven's network, the movements of hollow soldiers, the territories where emissaries recruited. Perin helped when he could—teaching Cassian how information flowed through the tethers, how the hierarchy worked, how Draven controlled his forces.

"These territories are overlapping," Perin said one night, pointing at Cassian's map. "That shouldn't happen. Emissaries have exclusive zones."

"What does overlap mean?" Cassian asked.

"Consolidation. Preparing for something big." Perin's expression darkened. "When I was hollow, we only did this before major operations. Mass recruitments. Or attacks."

Cassian felt the weight of that information settling. Draven was planning something. Something soon.

Which meant the Unhollow needed to act first.

Miles away, in a tent on the edge of Hollow territory, Draven Kane studied his maps and smiled.

The boy had freed one emissary. Proven the method could work. Good. That would make him confident. Reckless.

And when he inevitably tried to scale up—to restore multiple hollow soldiers at once—that's when Draven would teach him the truth about costs and consequences.

"Patience," he murmured to the locket containing Rowan's coin. "Your son is clever. But cleverness without experience is just arrogance waiting to be corrected."

He marked a building on his map. The recruitment center in the merchant district. Twenty-three fresh converts inside, barely hollowed for more than a week. Easy targets that would make Cassian feel like salvation was achievable.

While his real forces consolidated elsewhere.

Draven closed his ledger and settled in to wait.

Tomorrow would bring new lessons.

And Cassian would learn what it truly cost to play hero.
