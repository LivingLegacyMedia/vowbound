# Chapter 7: The Hollow Trade

The war council met in a circular chamber. A round table dominated the room—a symbol of equality, though the man at its head clearly held more power than the others. King Aldric himself, gray-bearded and grim-faced, watched as Cassian was led inside.

Around the table sat perhaps twenty people—nobles, military commanders, scholars in academic robes. They looked up as Cassian entered, and he saw the judgment in their eyes. Who was this nobody from nowhere? What could a village ledger-keeper possibly tell them that their own advisors hadn't already said?

Lord Herrick stood at the King's right hand. "Your Majesty, honored council, this is Cassian of Millhaven. He claims knowledge of the Hollow's methods."

"Claims," someone muttered. A nobleman in expensive red velvet. "Another peasant with empty theories."

Cassian ignored him. He bowed to the King. "Your Majesty. Thank you for hearing me."

King Aldric gestured to an empty chair. His voice was rougher than Cassian expected, gravelly with exhaustion. "Sit. Speak. We're listening. Though I'll warn you—we've heard seventeen advisors this week. Sixteen are now in the dungeon for wasting our time. Try not to be the seventeenth."

Cassian sat. Twenty pairs of eyes fixed on him. He took a breath and began.

"The Hollow doesn't conquer cities through military force," he said. "It conquers through trade. Every person who becomes hollow makes a voluntary exchange—their suffering, their pain, their debts, in return for emptiness and peace. It's not coercion. It's not mind control. It's a choice."

"We know this," a general interrupted. He was perhaps sixty, with scars across his knuckles and a face that had seen too many battles. "Tell us something useful. How do we stop people from making that choice?"

"You can't," Cassian said flatly. "Not directly. A willing trade can't be overruled without offering a better deal. All you can do is give people hope instead of despair. Give them reasons not to trade away their humanity."

"Platitudes," the nobleman in red scoffed. "We need military strategy, not philosophy."

"You need both," Cassian shot back. "Because your military strategy fails the moment Draven offers your soldiers an end to their fear. How do you command an army when half of them would rather turn on you than fight?"

That landed. Several council members shifted uncomfortably.

King Aldric leaned forward, studying Cassian with new interest. "You speak as if you know our enemy personally. Have you met him?"

"No. But I've studied his methods. I've seen the aftermath of his trades. And I know—" He hesitated. This was the dangerous part. "I know he possesses an artifact of immense power. A medallion that allows him to manipulate the human heart. To cheat the balance that normally governs our world."

The room went very quiet.

"How do you know this?" Herrick's voice was sharp.

Cassian met his gaze. "Because I possess one too."

He pulled the coin from his pocket and set it on the table.

The reaction was immediate. Gasps. Several people stood. The general's hand went to his sword hilt. But King Aldric held up a hand, silencing them.

"Peace," the King said. He studied the coin with intense focus, and Cassian saw something flicker in his eyes. Recognition? Fear? "I've heard stories of such artifacts. My grandfather's grandfather spoke of them in his journals. But I thought they were legend."

"They're real," Cassian said. "And Draven has corrupted his. He's found a way to profit without paying. To make trades where others bear his costs. That's why the Hollow exists—every person who becomes hollow is carrying debts that should have been his."

"That can't happen," someone said. "All the old stories say trades must balance—"

"It can happen if you know how to exploit the rules." Cassian picked up the coin, felt its warmth. "And he's perfected the technique. He's been doing this for years, building his power, creating an army of debt-bearers. And now—" He looked at the King. "Now he's coming here. To your city. Because there's another coin hidden somewhere in this capital city. And if he gets it, he'll be unstoppable."

The silence that followed was deafening.

Finally, King Aldric spoke. "How do you know there's a coin here?"

"Because I can feel it," Cassian said simply. "The coins recognize each other. Mine has been growing warmer since I entered the city. There's another fragment close. Very close."

Herrick and the King exchanged a look. Something passed between them—confirmation, perhaps. Or concern.

The general stood abruptly. "Your Majesty, with respect—if this coin is what draws Draven here, then this man makes the entire city a target. We should confiscate it. Lock it away. Get it out of the capital entirely."

"Agreed," said another nobleman. "For the safety of the realm—"

"You can't," Cassian interrupted. His hand closed protectively around the coin. "It's bonded to me. When my father died, it... chose me, I suppose. I don't fully understand it myself, but I know it won't work for anyone else. Not anymore."

"That's convenient," the general said coldly. "A peasant shows up claiming to have a magical artifact that makes him indispensable—"

"I do not make empty claims," Cassian said, keeping his voice level despite his rising pulse. "My father researched these coins for twenty years. They bond with their bearers. You can take it from me, but it will be useless to you. And if Draven is coming for it anyway, at least with me you have someone who knows how to use it."

The King held up a hand. "Enough. Master Cassian—is what the general says true? Does your presence here make us more of a target?"

Cassian met his gaze. No point in lying. "Yes. If Draven can sense fragments the way I can sense them... then yes, he likely knows I'm here. Or will soon."

Several council members erupted in protest. The King silenced them with a sharp gesture.

"Then we're already committed," King Aldric said grimly. "If he's coming either way, better to have two coins on our side than one on his. But Master Cassian—" His voice hardened. "Know that you've just made yourself the most valuable person in this city. And the most watched. If you betray us, if you so much as think about taking that coin to our enemy, you'll beg for death long before we grant it. Am I clear?"

Cassian swallowed. "Yes, Your Majesty."

"Good." The King looked around the council. "Now. We have other business. Specifically, the matter of Lord Corvan's alleged treason."

Cassian had almost forgotten. The summons had mentioned a traitor in the court.

"Bring him in," the King commanded.

---

Guards escorted Lord Corvan into the chamber. He was a tall man, perhaps fifty, with silver hair and the bearing of someone used to authority. But his hands were bound, and his fine clothes were rumpled from days in the dungeon. He looked exhausted. Broken.

But when his eyes met Cassian's, something flickered there. Recognition? No—calculation.

"Lord Corvan," the King said. "You stand accused of treason. Of communicating with Draven Kane. Of offering to sabotage our defenses in exchange for sparing your family's lands. How do you answer these charges?"

Corvan's voice was hoarse but steady. "I met with him. I won't deny it."

Murmurs around the table. The general looked furious. The nobles shocked.

"Why?" the King demanded.

"Because you summoned me to this city to lead your defenses, Your Majesty. I needed to understand what we were fighting. So I arranged a meeting under flag of truce. I went to his camp. I met him in his tent."

Corvan's gaze went distant, remembering. "I expected a warlord. A monster. Instead, I found a gentleman in fine clothes, sitting in a campaign chair, reading poetry. Horace, I think. Or maybe Virgil. He offered me wine. Expensive wine, from the southern provinces. We talked."

"About what?" Herrick demanded.

"About philosophy. About the nature of worth and power. About what men sacrifice for duty." Corvan's voice was quiet now, careful. "He was... magnificent. Articulate. He said that a father's first duty was to his children. That protecting one's family wasn't weakness—it was the only true loyalty. And when a man must choose between the lives of strangers and the lives of his own..." He trailed off.

"Then he made you an offer," the King said.

"Yes, Your Majesty. My cooperation for my family's safety. He would spare my lands, spare my children, let them grow old in peace. All I had to do was delay the fortification of the eastern walls. A small thing. A technical delay. He said it wouldn't even matter—that the war was already lost, and I was simply choosing which side to mourn on."

"But it would have left us vulnerable," the general said. "The eastern approach is crucial. If they breach there—"

"I know," Corvan said quietly. "I understood the consequences. But in that moment, sitting across from Draven Kane, drinking his wine, listening to his arguments—I couldn't think of anything but my children. Their faces. Their futures. Everything else seemed..." He shook his head. "Distant. Abstract. Like it was happening to other people in another life."

He looked at the King, his voice breaking. "That's what he does, Your Majesty. He doesn't force you. He doesn't threaten. He just... shows you what you value most. Makes it so vivid, so immediate, that everything else fades. And in that clarity, terrible choices seem reasonable."

The room was silent.

"Did you accept his offer?" the King asked quietly.

Corvan closed his eyes. "Yes. God help me, yes. I agreed. I traded my loyalty for a promise."

"Then you admit your treason."

"I admit that I was weak. That I let him show me what I valued most, and I chose it over duty." Corvan opened his eyes. "But I never acted on it. The moment I returned to the city, the weight of what I'd agreed to crashed down on me. The guilt. The shame. I couldn't do it. So I did nothing. Stalled. Made excuses. And eventually, your investigators found correspondence I was too careless to destroy."

He looked directly at Cassian. That calculating look. "So here I am. A traitor by intent if not by action. Awaiting your judgment."

King Aldric was quiet for a long moment. Then he turned to Cassian. "You said you understand trade. Tell me—is this man telling the truth?"

All eyes turned to Cassian. He felt the weight of the question. Felt the coin warm against his palm.

He focused on Corvan, letting his perception open. Saw the shimmer of value around the man. Saw shame, thick and dark. Saw regret. But also—

Something else. Something hollow.

Cassian frowned. He pushed his perception deeper, trying to understand what he was sensing. The impressions came in fragments, abstractions. *Children. Love. Loss.* But the quality was wrong. Distant. Like hearing music through a wall.

Was it corruption? Or just trauma? He couldn't tell.

"He's telling the truth," Cassian said carefully. "He made the trade. He regrets it. The guilt is genuine."

Relief flickered across several faces. Even Corvan looked grateful.

But something nagged at Cassian. Something about those impressions. The way they felt hollow, distant. Like they'd been...

No. He was seeing corruption everywhere now, after what the Dealer had told him. Corvan's guilt was real. His regret was real. Cassian could see that clearly.

"Execute him," the general said flatly. "Treason is treason, whether acted upon or not."

Several council members nodded agreement.

"Wait," Cassian heard himself say.

Everyone turned to him.

"Your Majesty," Cassian said, his mind racing. "Lord Corvan met with Draven directly. He's seen his methods. Heard his arguments. He might know things about the enemy's plans—military positions, strategies, weaknesses."

"We've tried interrogation," Herrick said. "He's been trained to resist. We've gotten nothing useful."

"But I can trade for it," Cassian said. The idea was forming even as he spoke. "If Lord Corvan is willing. Information for..." He hesitated. What could he offer a condemned man? What could balance military intelligence worth thousands of lives?

He thought of Mira. Of her brother Torin, holding that locket for three days before finally opening it. Trading his grief for emptiness because he couldn't carry the pain anymore.

Corvan was carrying pain too. The guilt of betrayal. The knowledge of what he'd almost done. The faces of his children, whom he'd nearly sold for a promise.

"For mercy," Cassian said slowly. "Not a pardon. But... freedom from the memories that torment you. The guilt. The shame. The faces of your children that haunt you when you close your eyes. I might be able to take those from you. In exchange for everything you know about Draven Kane."

The room erupted.

"That's monstrous," someone said.

"Tampering with a man's mind—"

But Corvan was staring at Cassian with something like desperate hope. "You can do that? Take specific memories?"

Cassian's mouth was dry. Could he? He'd only seen it done once—by the Dealer, who'd ripped his mother's face from his mind with terrible precision. But he understood the principle now: the coin perceived value in all forms, including memories. And when he focused on someone, he could sense what they valued most—their deepest needs, their heaviest burdens. If he could sense memories, perhaps he could grasp them. Transfer them.

It was theory. Dangerous theory. But Corvan was already broken, and they needed what he knew.

"I can try," Cassian said carefully. "Someone taught me—showed me—that memories can be traded like anything else. I've never attempted it myself. But when both parties agree, if he's willing, it should be possible."

"Should?" Herrick said sharply. "You're not certain?"

"No," Cassian admitted. "For all I know, I might damage his mind. Or my own. Or the trade might simply fail. I don't know."

The council erupted again. Too dangerous. Too uncertain. Too much risk.

But King Aldric raised a hand, silencing them. He studied both men carefully—Corvan, desperate and broken, and Cassian, offering something that should be impossible.

"Lord Corvan," the King said. "You understand the risks? That this might fail? That it might leave you worse than you are now?"

"Yes, Your Majesty."

"And you still wish to proceed?"

"I do." Corvan's voice was steady now. "If I'm to die a traitor, at least let me die without seeing my children's faces in my final moments. Without remembering everything I betrayed. That's worth any risk."

The King was silent for a long moment. Then he nodded. "Make the trade. If it succeeds and the information proves valuable, Lord Corvan receives a quick death. Painless. That's more mercy than he deserves, but it's what we can offer." He looked at Cassian. "If it fails—we'll discuss consequences then."

Cassian's hands were shaking as he stood. What was he doing? He had no idea if this would work. No idea what he'd unleash. But the council was watching, and Corvan was waiting, and somewhere in the man's mind was information that could save thousands of lives.

*And you need it,* a voice whispered in his head. *You need to prove yourself. You need access to the King's resources. You need to not fail again like you failed Millhaven.*

Was that why he was doing this? To prove something?

The guards cleared a space. Cassian approached Corvan slowly. Up close, he could see the exhaustion etched in the man's face. The resignation. The guilt eating him alive.

"Are you certain?" Cassian asked quietly. "I'm pretty sure we can't undo this."

"I'm certain." Corvan met his gaze. "Take them. Take the memories of my children's faces. Their voices. Everything that makes them mine. And in return, I'll give you everything I know about Draven Kane."

Cassian nodded, though his heart was racing. He pressed the coin between his palms, focusing. The coin was hotter than usual, almost burning. He reached out with his perception, the same sense that let him detect value in objects and desperation in people. But this time he pushed deeper, searching for the specific weight of memory in Corvan's mind.

There. He could sense them—threads of love and pain, woven together. *Children, faces, voices.* The memories Corvan treasured most, even as they tortured him. They appeared to Cassian's coin-sense like gossamer strands, delicate and precious. He extended his awareness carefully, trying to take hold of them them the way the Dealer had grasped his mother's face.

The coin grew scorching hot in his hands. Cassian gasped but didn't let go. He could feel something shifting—the coin responding to his intent, to both parties' agreement. The trade was balanced. Both sides willing. The coin *should* facilitate it.

He closed his mental grip on the memory-threads and pulled, drawing them toward himself while pushing Corvan's knowledge of Draven back in exchange.

The transfer was violent. Chaotic. Nothing like the smooth extraction the Dealer had performed. Memories ripped from Corvan like pages torn from a book—jagged, incomplete. Faces appeared in Cassian's mind—two daughters, a son—but they were fragmentary, distorted. Their features kept shifting, refusing to solidify.

Children he'd never met, but who now lived in his thoughts like ghosts. Voices calling "Papa" but the sound was wrong, echoing, hollow.

And in exchange, information poured back—but it was raw, unorganized. Military positions tangled with personal memories. Supply lines mixed with emotions. Everything Corvan knew about Draven spilling out in a chaotic flood.

Cassian felt Corvan's memories crash into his mind like a wave. Tasted wine in a tent that smelled of leather and old books. Heard Draven's voice, smooth and persuasive: *"Your children deserve better than dying for someone else's kingdom."* Saw maps spread across a campaign table, positions marked in red. Felt the weight of impossible choices.

The transfer took perhaps thirty seconds, but it felt like hours. When it ended, both men staggered.

Cassian caught himself on the table's edge, gasping. Pain lanced through his skull like a hot needle. The new memories were wrong—invasive and incomplete at the same time. Children that weren't his but felt like they should be, except their faces kept slipping away like water through his fingers. Love that belonged to someone else pressing into his mind like a thorn. And underneath it all, something cold. Something hollow.

Corvan collapsed. Guards caught him before he hit the floor. His eyes were unfocused, mouth slack. For a terrifying moment, Cassian thought he'd broken the man's mind entirely.

"Did it work?" someone asked urgently.

Corvan's eyes focused slowly, like a man waking from a nightmare. "What... what did I trade?"

"Your children," the King said quietly. "Their memories."

"Children?" Corvan's voice was distant, confused. "Do I have children?"

"You did," Herrick said. "But you won't remember them now."

Corvan nodded slowly, mechanically. "Good. That's... good." He looked around the room as if seeing it for the first time. "What was I supposed to tell you?"

"Draven's plans," the King prompted.

"Oh. Yes." Corvan's voice was hollow now. Empty. "His main force will approach from the east, as expected. But he's sent a smaller force around to the north—they'll strike at the supply depots outside the city walls while the main army engages at the eastern gates. A two-pronged assault. He expects you'll fortify the eastern approach, so he's already planned the northern strike as his primary objective."

The general was scribbling notes frantically. "How large is the northern force?"

"Perhaps three thousand. Mixed infantry and cavalry. They'll hit tomorrow night, under new moon. Dark enough to approach undetected."

"Tomorrow?" The general looked up sharply. "That's impossibly fast. Our scouts would have—"

"Your scouts are compromised," Corvan said flatly. "Or dead. He's been moving forces for weeks. You just haven't seen them."

The general's face darkened. He looked at the King. "Your Majesty, we can't take this intelligence at face value. This could be disinformation. If we redeploy forces to the north and leave the eastern approach vulnerable—"

"It could be a trap," another commander agreed. "We'd be dividing our strength based on a traitor's word."

"But if it's true and we ignore it," Herrick said, "we lose our supply lines. The siege becomes unwinnable."

The King held up a hand. "Send scouts. Quietly. Have them verify what they can about northern movements. But also reinforce the eastern walls as planned—we can't leave them exposed." He looked at the general. "How long until we know if this intelligence is accurate?"

"If there's a force of three thousand moving through the northern approach? We should be able to confirm or deny it by dawn tomorrow. If they're not there—"

"Then we know Lord Corvan was fed false information," the King finished. "Or the trade itself was compromised somehow." He looked at the prisoner, then at Cassian. "In which case, both of you will have much to answer for."

Cassian barely heard them. He was still processing what he'd taken—or what he'd tried to take. The memories wouldn't settle properly in his mind. They kept shifting, refusing to integrate. Like trying to hold water in his bare hands.

He focused on one of the daughters' faces. Tried to see her clearly. But the image was blurry. Indistinct. Not like a real memory but like a copy of a copy of a copy. The emotional weight was there—love, fierce and protective—but the actual details kept slipping away.

And underneath, that hollowness. That wrongness.

*They're already corrupted,* he realized with dawning horror. *Draven got to them already. Or I damaged them trying to extract them.*

Either way, he'd accepted poison. And the coin had facilitated it because technically, Corvan *had* given him memories of his children. Just not intact ones. Not real ones.

"Master Cassian," the King's voice cut through his spiraling thoughts. "That was... disturbing to witness. Are you well?"

Cassian forced himself to straighten. "The trade was more difficult than I expected, Your Majesty. I've never attempted anything like that before."

"That was apparent." The King studied him carefully. "The information Corvan provided—do you believe it's accurate?"

Cassian hesitated. In the jumble of memories and intelligence, he'd seen—or thought he'd seen—Draven's war room. Maps. Positions. Plans. But it was all tangled together, fragmentary, possibly corrupted.

"I received something from him," Cassian said carefully. "Intelligence, memories, all mixed together. But I can't guarantee its accuracy. He could have been fed false information before he returned. Or..." He struggled with how much to admit. "Or the memories themselves could have been corrupted somehow. I don't know enough to say for certain."

The general grunted. "At least he's honest about it. We'll verify what we can through scouts. If the intelligence proves false, we'll know tomorrow."

"And if it proves true," Herrick said quietly, "then despite the... irregularity... Master Cassian may have just saved the city."

"We'll see," King Aldric said. His eyes were hard as they fixed on Cassian. "You've given us much to consider. Both about the Hollow's methods and your own abilities. You've earned a place in this court—but also earned considerable scrutiny. Don't make me regret allowing you to keep that coin."

"Yes, Your Majesty."

Guards led Corvan away. The man went without resistance, his face peaceful in a way that made Cassian's stomach turn. Empty. Hollow.

*What have I done?*

---

The council session continued for another hour, but Cassian barely registered it. Orders were issued. Forces deployed. Scouts sent to verify Corvan's intelligence. Nobles rushed off to secure their estates. The general argued about defensive positions.

Cassian sat in his chair, the hollow memories whispering at the edge of his consciousness. Children's faces he couldn't quite see. Voices he couldn't quite hear. And beneath it all, something watching. Waiting. A coldness that had nothing to do with temperature.

Finally, Lord Herrick dismissed him. "The King wants a full report by morning. Everything you know about the Hollow's methods. Everything you learned from that trade. We'll send someone to your lodgings for it."

"What lodgings?"

"You're staying at the Broken Wheel, are you not? We know where all the petitioners are staying, Master Cassian. We've known since you entered the city." Herrick's smile was thin. "You're being watched. For your own safety, of course."

Of course.

Cassian stumbled out of the palace as evening fell. His head throbbed. His vision blurred at the edges. The hollow memories pressed against his thoughts like fingers probing a wound.

He'd won. He'd gained the King's attention, proven his value, secured his place in the court. He'd extracted crucial intelligence that might save the city.

So why did it feel like he'd lost something far more important?

The city streets were quieter now, shops closing early. People retreated to their homes. Tomorrow the Hollow's forces would attack—if Corvan's intelligence was accurate. If it wasn't a trap. If Cassian hadn't just helped spring whatever plan Draven had laid years in advance.

*The difference between you and Draven Kane is smaller than you think,* the Dealer had said.

Cassian was beginning to understand what that meant.

He walked aimlessly, lost in thought, the coin heavy in his pocket. The hollow memories whispered. Children calling for a father who'd forgotten them. Love with no face attached. Grief without substance.

He found himself near the palace gardens, in a small square with a fountain that no longer ran. A few vendors remained, packing up their stalls for the night.

And there, sitting on the fountain's edge, was Mira.

She looked up as he approached, and her expression shifted from casual interest to immediate concern. "Saints above—what happened to you?"

"I..." Cassian's voice came out rough. "I made a trade."

"It went badly." Not a question.

"I don't know. Maybe. I can't tell." He sat heavily beside her, head in his hands. "I tried to do something I wasn't ready for. Something I've only seen done once by something far more powerful than me. And now I don't know if I helped anyone or if I just played into exactly what he wanted."

Mira was quiet for a moment. Then she pulled a flask from her pack and offered it to him. "Drink. You look like you need it."

He drank. Whatever it was burned going down, but it helped center him. Gave him something to focus on besides the whispers in his head.

"Want to talk about it?" Mira asked.

"Not particularly. It's... complicated. And I'm not sure I can explain without breaking several promises to the King."

"Fair enough." She took the flask back, drank. "Did you find anything that might help me? With my brother?"

The question hit him like a physical blow. In all the chaos of the council, the trade, the aftermath—he'd completely forgotten about Mira's desperate search.

"No," he admitted. "I'm sorry. There wasn't time. The council was focused on military intelligence, and I—"

"It's fine," Mira said quickly. Too quickly. "I understand. You have bigger concerns than one girl's missing brother."

But her voice was hollow. Disappointed. She stood, shouldering her pack. "I should go. I have more searching to do tomorrow."

"Mira, wait—"

"It's fine, Cassian. Really. You tried. That's more than most people." She managed a small smile. "Good luck with whatever you're doing for the King. I hope it works out better than you think it did."

She started to walk away.

"Three thousand soldiers," Cassian said suddenly. "Moving through the northern approach. That's where they're massing the newly converted. If your brother was taken three weeks ago, there's a chance he's with that force."

Mira stopped. Turned back slowly. "How do you know this?"

"The trade I made. I learned things. Military positions. Troop movements. It's not confirmed, but—" He met her gaze. "If you're going to search, search northeast of the city. Near the old aqueduct ruins. That's where they're staging."

Hope flared in her eyes. Dangerous hope. "You're certain?"

"No. The information could be false. Or corrupted. Or bait. But it's the best lead I have."

She sat back down beside him, suddenly intense. "Tell me everything."

So he did. Leaving out the details about the coin, about the memory extraction, about his growing suspicion that he'd been manipulated—but giving her the military intelligence. The positions. The timing. Everything that might help her find her brother.

When he finished, Mira was quiet for a long moment.

"You did this for me?" she finally asked.

"I did this for a lot of reasons," Cassian said honestly. "The King needed intelligence. I needed to prove myself. I needed to not fail again like I failed my town." He looked at her. "But yes. Part of me was thinking about you when I made the offer. About your brother. About whether there's still time to save him."

"Thank you," she said quietly. "Even if it doesn't work out. Thank you for trying."

They sat in silence for a moment. Then Mira spoke again, her voice careful.

"What you said before. About trying to do something you weren't ready for. About not knowing if you helped or played into his hands." She looked at him. "That's what I'm most afraid of with Torin. That even if I find him, even if there's a way to bring him back—I'll just make things worse. Trade one kind of emptiness for another."

"Then why keep searching?"

"Because he's my brother. Because I have to try, even if trying is what damns us both." She smiled sadly. "I think you understand that. Trying even when you're not sure. Even when you might be making it worse."

Cassian did understand. Too well.

"The attack is coming tomorrow night," he said. "If you're going to search the northern approach, you need to do it during the day. Before the battle starts. And you need to be careful. If they catch you—"

"I know." Mira stood again. "Come with me."

"What?"

"Come with me. Tomorrow. Before whatever happens happens. You need to see what you're fighting. Really see it. Not through council meetings or secondhand intelligence. And I could use someone who understands how they work. How to maybe break them."

Cassian thought about it. The King expected a report by morning. The palace was watching him. Leaving the city to chase Hollow forces right before an attack was insane.

But when had that stopped him?

"Alright," he said. "Tomorrow. Before dawn. We search the northern approach."

Mira's smile was genuine this time. "Thank you. I'll meet you at the north gate. Bring whatever you need to defend yourself. And Cassian?"

"Yes?"

"Whatever trade you made today—whatever you think went wrong—try not to let it get to you. I've seen what guilt does to people. How it eats them from the inside. My brother drowned in it before the Hollow ever touched him." Her eyes were sad. "Don't let it win."

Then she was gone, disappearing into the evening crowd.

Cassian sat alone by the fountain. The hollow memories whispered in his mind. Somewhere in the city, Draven's forces were positioning for tomorrow's attack. Somewhere in the city, another fragment waited to be found.

And somewhere, his enemy was watching through the poisoned memories Cassian had been foolish enough to accept. Or maybe Cassian had simply damaged himself trying to do something he had no business attempting.

Either way, he'd crossed a line today. Taken something from someone's mind. Changed them fundamentally. For intelligence, yes. For the greater good, maybe. But also for his own purposes. To prove himself. To not fail again.

*The difference between you and Draven Kane is smaller than you think.*

He touched the coin in his pocket. Still warm. Still pulsing with that strange life.

Tomorrow he'd search for Mira's brother. Tomorrow he'd try to undo some of what he'd helped create. Tomorrow he'd try to be better than he'd been today.

But tonight, he just sat by a fountain that no longer ran, in a city preparing for war, carrying memories of children he'd never met and intelligence that might doom them all.

A scream cut through the evening air.

Cassian was on his feet immediately, running toward the sound. Others were running too—toward the southern gates. Toward the refugee camps outside the walls.

Fire. He could see it now, rising in orange columns against the darkening sky. Not just one fire. Dozens. The camps were burning.

And cutting through the smoke and screams, a sound that made his blood run cold: laughter. Calm. Empty. Hollow.

The attack wasn't coming tomorrow night.

It was coming now.
