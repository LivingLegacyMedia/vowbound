# Chapter 6: The Price of a Name

The journey to the capital took five days through autumn rain and roads churned to mud. Cassian pushed the old mare harder than was wise, sleeping in barns and cheap inns when he slept at all. His father's journals stayed wrapped in oiled cloth at the bottom of his pack, but their contents consumed his thoughts. 

*The fragments know each other,* the Dealer had said. *Find the others before he does.*

Cassian still couldn't remember his mother's face. Every morning, he woke reaching for the memory. Every morning, he found only emptiness. The loss was getting easier to bear—which somehow made it worse. He was learning to live with the absence, learning to function with a piece of himself carved out. That was the true weight of the Dealer's price: not the initial agony, but the slow normalization of grief.

The coin grew warmer as he rode south. By the third day, it felt feverish against his chest, pulsing with heat that had nothing to do with his body temperature. Something was near. Another fragment, perhaps. Or Draven himself.

Cassian tried not to think about that.

---

The capital of Arvenstead rose from the plains like a gray tooth, all stone walls and crowded towers pressed together behind battlements that had stood for three hundred years. Cassian had been here once as a child, when his father still had money for such trips. He remembered markets that stretched for blocks, merchants speaking a dozen languages, the King's palace rising white and gold above the city like a second sun.

Now, refugee camps sprawled outside the walls. Thousands of displaced families lived in tents and lean-tos, their smoke rising in thin columns against the autumn sky. Guards patrolled the main gates, turning away more people than they admitted. The city was full. The city was afraid.

Cassian joined the line at the South Gate. It took two hours to reach the checkpoint. By then, rain was falling again, cold and relentless.

"Name and business," the guard said without looking up from his ledger.

"Cassian of Millhaven. I've come to answer the King's summons." He produced the paper Seris had given him, now stained and crumpled from travel.

The guard's expression shifted from bored to skeptical. "You and half the kingdom, apparently." He studied the summons more carefully. "Says here you're a... ledger-keeper?" He pronounced it like an accusation.

"That's correct."

"And you think a ledger-keeper can help the King defeat the Hollow." Not a question. A judgment.

Cassian met his gaze. "I think the King asked for people who understand trade. I understand trade."

The guard snorted but waved him through. "Palace is in the upper city. Ask at the Falcon Inn if you need lodging. If you can afford it." He looked at Cassian's travel-stained clothes and muddy boots with open doubt.

Cassian led his horse through the gate and into the capital.

---

The city was everything he remembered and nothing like it. The markets were still there, but subdued. Merchants sold their wares quietly, without the shouts and competing offers he recalled from childhood. People moved through the streets with their heads down, hurrying. No one lingered. No one seemed comfortable being outside their homes.

He saw why soon enough. On every corner, on every market square, someone was preaching. Hollow converts, he realized with a chill. They stood on boxes and crates, speaking in calm, measured voices about peace and freedom from suffering. Small crowds gathered to listen—drawn by curiosity or desperation, Cassian couldn't tell.

"Trade your debts for deliverance," one preacher said. A woman in her thirties, hollow-eyed but smiling. "I once carried the weight of seven children I couldn't feed. Sleepless nights. Hungry cries. The guilt of every empty belly. The Hollow took it all. Now I sleep soundly. Now I am free. You can be free too."

A young man beside her nodded. "I lost my legs in the war. The pain was unbearable. Every morning, waking to agony. Every night, praying for death. The Hollow offered me a trade: my memories of walking, for freedom from suffering. I accepted. I am hollow, yes. But I am also finally at peace."

People in the crowd murmured. Some looked horrified. Others looked tempted.

Cassian wanted to shout at them. *Don't you understand? They're not free—they're empty!* But the words stuck in his throat. Because looking at the woman's smile, the young man's calm—it *was* a kind of peace. A terrible peace, but peace nonetheless. They weren't lying. They had traded their pain for emptiness, and to them, the bargain was fair.

He thought of Millhaven. Thought of the refugees who'd stumbled into town, hollow-eyed and lost. Thought of the choice his town would have made by now. Had they accepted the Hollow's offer? Had the magistrate signed the contracts? Was everyone he'd known—widow Marta, the merchants, the neighbors—were they all hollow now?

He realized with sick certainty: they probably were. He'd abandoned them. Left them to save themselves the only way available. And they'd chosen survival, even if it meant losing everything that made survival worthwhile.

The guilt settled onto his shoulders like a physical weight.

---

He found lodging at a cheaper inn near the docks, paying what little coin he had left for a narrow room with a single window overlooking the river. The palace would have to wait until morning. He was exhausted, filthy, and the coin was burning against his chest like a brand.

That night, he dreamed.

Not of his mother—those dreams were impossible now, her face erased from his sleeping mind along with his waking one. Instead, he dreamed of the old marketplace beneath the earth. The Dealer standing in darkness, void-eyes watching.

**"You paid the price,"** the Dealer's voice echoed through the stone chamber. **"Now you must learn what you bought."**

The scene shifted. Cassian saw a city—not Arvenstead, but somewhere older. Stone buildings in a style he didn't recognize. In the city square, a man stood on a platform. Young. Handsome. Wearing fine clothes and holding something golden in his palm.

Draven.

Even in the dream, Cassian knew him. Knew the way he moved, the way he smiled. The way people gathered around him, drawn by charisma that shouldn't be possible.

"I offer you freedom," dream-Draven said, his voice carrying across the square. "Freedom from your suffering. From your debts. From your shame. All I ask is a simple trade—your pain for my peace. Your burden for my blessing."

He held up the golden object. A locket, Cassian realized. Beautiful and terrible at once.

"Open this," Draven continued, "and your suffering ends. All of it. I promise you—no tricks, no deception. You will feel nothing. And feeling nothing is better than feeling what you feel now. Isn't it?"

The crowd surged forward. Desperate. Eager. And one by one, people opened the lockets Draven's servants distributed. One by one, Cassian watched the light fade from their eyes. Watched them become empty vessels, smiling and calm and hollow.

And Draven smiled. Not with cruelty, but with satisfaction. Like a merchant completing a successful transaction.

The dream shifted again. Now Cassian stood in darkness, the coin hot in his hand. The Dealer's voice whispered from everywhere and nowhere:

**"He excels at what you have only begun to understand. He offers exactly what people want and exactly what will destroy them."**

"How do I stop him?" Cassian asked the darkness.

**"You cannot. Not as you are."** A pause. **"But you have paid for knowledge. So I will give you this: He is coming to the capital. He seeks what you seek. The fragment hidden in stone and gold. Find it first, or everything you have sacrificed will be for nothing."**

Cassian woke gasping, heart racing. Dawn light crept through the window. The coin was cool now, merely warm against his chest. But the dream's urgency remained.

He had to reach the palace. Had to warn them.

Had to find the fragment before Draven did.

---

The palace stood at the city's highest point, its white stone walls gilded by morning sun. Guards in formal dress lined the approach—twice as many as normal, Cassian guessed. Security was tight. The kingdom was preparing for war.

He joined another line, this one of petitioners, scholars, and supposed advisors. All answering the King's summons. All claiming they could help. The guards processed them slowly, checking credentials, asking questions, turning away anyone suspicious.

When Cassian's turn came, he presented the summons again. This time, the guard actually read it carefully.

"Ledger-keeper from Millhaven," the guard said. "Says here you have knowledge of the Hollow's methods."

"I do."

"Prove it."

Cassian hadn't expected that. He thought for a moment, then said: "The Hollow doesn't conquer. It barters. Every person who becomes hollow makes a choice. They trade away suffering in exchange for emptiness. It's voluntary. That's what makes it so effective—people willingly accept their loss."

The guard's expression shifted. "How do you know this?"

"Because I've seen it. I've seen the contracts they sign. I've spoken with refugees who barely escaped." He met the guard's gaze. "And I understand trade well enough to recognize exploitation when I see it."

The guard studied him for a long moment. Then he nodded. "Wait here."

Ten minutes later, a palace official arrived—a thin man in expensive clothes who introduced himself as Lord Herrick, the King's chamberlain. He looked Cassian up and down with obvious distaste.

"You're the ledger-keeper?" Herrick's tone suggested he'd expected someone more impressive.

"I am."

"And you claim to understand the Hollow's methods?"

"I don't claim. I do."

Herrick's eyes narrowed. "Bold words. The King has wasted enough time on confidence without competence. If you're another charlatan seeking royal patronage, you'll find yourself in the dungeon rather quickly."

"I'm not seeking patronage. I'm seeking information." Cassian kept his voice level. "The King summoned advisors who understand trade. I understand trade. I also have questions the King's court might be able to answer."

"Questions?" Herrick looked skeptical. "About what?"

Cassian chose his words carefully. "About historical artifacts. About items of value that the Hollow might be seeking. About—" He paused. "About fragments."

Something flickered in Herrick's eyes. Recognition. Maybe fear.

"Come with me," Herrick said quietly. "The council meets this afternoon. You'll present your knowledge then. If it proves valuable, the King will see you. If not..." He didn't finish the threat.

Cassian followed him into the palace.

---

They gave him a room to wait in—small but clean, with a window overlooking the palace gardens. A servant brought bread, cheese, and watered wine. Cassian ate mechanically, his mind racing.

Herrick had recognized the word "fragments." That meant the King knew about them, or at least knew enough to understand their significance. Which meant there might be records. Archives. Maybe even the fragment itself, hidden somewhere in the palace.

But it also meant danger. If Draven was coming here—if he knew the fragment's location—then the entire city was in his path. And Cassian was putting himself directly in the line of fire.

The coin pulsed warmth against his chest. Reassuring or warning, he couldn't tell.

He spent the afternoon reviewing his father's journals, preparing arguments, thinking through how to explain what he'd learned without sounding insane. How did you tell a council of nobles that an alchemist had found a way to cheat the fundamental laws of reality?

That their enemy wasn't a warlord or tyrant, but a philosopher who understood human nature better than anyone alive?

When the servant came to summon him to the council chamber, Cassian still didn't know if he had the words. But he was out of time.

---

The war council met in a circular chamber near the throne room. A round table dominated the space—a symbol of equality, Cassian supposed, though the man at its head clearly held more power than the others. King Aldric himself, gray-bearded and grim-faced, watched as Cassian was led inside.

Around the table sat perhaps twenty people—nobles, military commanders, scholars in academic robes. They looked up as Cassian entered, and he saw the judgment in their eyes. Who was this nobody from nowhere? What could a village ledger-keeper possibly tell them that their own advisors hadn't already said?

Lord Herrick stood at the King's right hand. "Your Majesty, honored council, this is Cassian of Millhaven. He claims knowledge of the Hollow's methods."

"Claims," someone muttered. A nobleman in expensive red velvet. "Another peasant with theories."

Cassian ignored him. He bowed to the King. "Your Majesty. Thank you for hearing me."

King Aldric gestured to an empty chair. "Sit. Speak. We're listening."

Cassian sat. Twenty pairs of eyes fixed on him. He took a breath and began.

"The Hollow doesn't conquer cities through military force," he said. "It conquers through trade. Every person who becomes hollow makes a voluntary exchange—their suffering, their pain, their debts, in return for emptiness and peace. It's not coercion. It's not mind control. It's a choice."

"We know this," a general said impatiently. "Tell us something useful. How do we stop people from making that choice?"

"You can't," Cassian said flatly. "Not directly. A willing trade can't be overruled without offering a better deal. All you can do is give people hope instead of despair. Give them reasons not to trade away their humanity."

"Platitudes," the nobleman in red scoffed. "We need military strategy, not philosophy."

"You need both," Cassian shot back. "Because your military strategy fails the moment Draven offers your soldiers an end to their fear. How do you command an army when half of them would rather be hollow than fight?"

That landed. Several council members shifted uncomfortably.

King Aldric leaned forward. "You speak as if you know our enemy personally. Have you met him?"

"No. But I've studied his methods. I've seen the aftermath of his trades. And I know—" He hesitated. This was the dangerous part. "I know he possesses an artifact of immense power. A coin that allows him to manipulate value itself. To cheat the balance that normally governs all exchanges."

The room went very quiet.

"How do you know this?" Herrick's voice was sharp.

Cassian met his gaze. "Because I possess one too."

He pulled the coin from his pocket and set it on the table.

The reaction was immediate. Gasps. Several people stood. The general's hand went to his sword hilt. But King Aldric held up a hand, silencing them.

"Peace," the King said. He studied the coin with intense focus. "I've heard stories of such artifacts. My grandfather's grandfather spoke of them in his journals. But I thought they were legend."

"They're real," Cassian said. "And Draven has corrupted his. He's found a way to profit without paying. To make trades where others bear his costs. That's why the Hollow exists—every person who becomes hollow is carrying debts that should have been his."

"That can't happen." someone said. "All the stories..."

"It can happen if you know how to exploit the rules." Cassian picked up the coin, felt its warmth. "And he's perfected the technique. He's been doing this for years, building his power, creating an army of debt-bearers. And now—" He looked at the King. "Now he's coming here. To your city. Because there's another coin hidden somewhere in this capital city. And if he gets it, he'll be unstoppable."

The silence that followed was deafening.

Finally, King Aldric spoke. "How do you know there's a coin here?"

"Because I can feel it," Cassian said simply. "The coins recognize each other. Mine has been growing warmer since I entered the city. There's another fragment close. Very close."

Herrick and the King exchanged a look. Something passed between them—confirmation, perhaps. Or concern.

"If what you say is true," the King said slowly, "then you've just made yourself extremely valuable. Or extremely dangerous." He studied Cassian carefully. "Which are you?"

The general stood abruptly. "Your Majesty, with respect, if this coin is what draws Draven here, then this man makes the entire city a target. We should confiscate it. Lock it in a vault. Get it out of the capital entirely."

"Agreed," said another nobleman. "For the safety of the kingdom"

"You can't," Cassian interrupted. His hand closed protectively around the coin. "It's bonded to me. When my father died, it... chose me, I suppose. I don't fully understand it myself, but I know it won't work for anyone else. Not anymore."

"That's convenient," the general said coldly. "A peasant shows up claiming to have a magical artifact that makes him indispensable—"

"I make no empty claims," Cassian said. "My father researched these coins for twenty years. They bond with their bearers. You can take it from me, but it will be useless to you. And if Draven is coming for it anyway, at least with me you have someone who knows how to use it."

The King held up a hand. "Enough. Master Cassian—is what the general says true? Does your presence here make us more of a target?"

Cassian met his gaze. No point in lying. "Yes. If Draven can sense fragments the same way I can... then yes, he likely knows I'm here. Or will soon."

Several council members erupted in protest. The King silenced them with a sharp gesture.

"Then we're already committed," King Aldric said grimly. "If he's coming either way, better to have two coins on our side than one on his. But Master Cassian—" His voice hardened. "Know that you've just made yourself the most valuable person in this city. And the most dangerous. If you betray us, if you so much as think about taking that coin to our enemy, you'll beg for death long before we grant it."

Cassian swallowed. "Understood, Your Majesty."

"Good." The King looked around the council. "Now. We have other business to attend to. Specifically, the matter of Lord Corvan's alleged treason."

Cassian had almost forgotten. The summons had mentioned a traitor in the court. Someone feeding information to the enemy.

"Bring him in," the King commanded.

---

Guards escorted Lord Corvan into the chamber. He was a tall man, perhaps fifty, with silver hair and the bearing of someone used to authority. But his hands were bound, and his fine clothes were rumpled from days in the dungeon. He looked exhausted. Broken.

But when his eyes met Cassian's, something flickered there. Recognition? No—calculation.

"Lord Corvan," the King said. "You stand accused of treason. Of communicating with Draven Kane. Of offering to sabotage our defenses in exchange for sparing your family's lands. How do you answer these charges?"

Corvan's voice was hoarse but steady. "I met with him. I won't deny it."

Murmurs around the table. The general looked furious. The nobles shocked.

"Why?" the King demanded.

"Because you summoned me to this city to lead your defenses, Your Majesty. I needed to understand what we were fighting. So I arranged a meeting under flag of truce. I went to his camp. I met him in his tent."

Corvan's gaze went distant, remembering. "I expected a warlord. A monster. Instead, I found a gentleman in fine clothes, sitting in a campaign chair, reading poetry. Horace, I think. Or maybe Virgil. He offered me wine. Expensive wine, from the southern provinces. We talked."

"About what?" Herrick demanded.

"About philosophy. About the nature of worth and power. About what men sacrifice for duty." Corvan's voice was quiet now, careful. "He was... magnificent. Articulate. Persuasive. He said that a father's first duty was to his children. That protecting one's family wasn't weakness—it was the only true loyalty. And when a man must choose between the lives of strangers and the lives of his own..." He trailed off.

"He made you an offer," the King said.

"Yes, Your Majesty. My cooperation for my family's safety. He would spare my lands, spare my children, let them grow old in peace. All I had to do was delay the fortification of the eastern walls. A small thing. A technical delay. He said it wouldn't even matter—that the war was already lost, and I was simply choosing which side to mourn on."

"But it would have left us vulnerable," the general said. "The eastern approach is crucial. If they breach there—"

"I know," Corvan said quietly. "I understood the consequences. But in that moment, sitting across from Draven Kane, drinking his wine, listening to his arguments—I couldn't think of anything but my children. Their faces. Their futures. Everything else seemed..." He shook his head. "Distant. Like it was happening to other people in another life."

He looked at the King, his voice breaking. "That's what he does, Your Majesty. He doesn't force you to do his bidding. He doesn't threaten. He just... shows you what you value most. Makes it so vivid, so immediate, that everything else fades. And in that clarity, terrible choices seem reasonable."

The room was silent.

"Did you accept his offer?" the King asked quietly.

Corvan closed his eyes. "Yes. God help me, yes. I agreed. I traded my loyalty for a promise."

"Then you admit your treason."

"I admit that I was weak. That I let him show me what I valued most, and I chose it over duty." Corvan opened his eyes. "But I never acted on it. The moment I returned to the city, the weight of what I'd agreed to crashed down on me. The guilt. The shame. I couldn't do it. So I did nothing. Stalled. Made excuses. And eventually, your investigators found correspondence I'd been too careless to destroy."

He looked at Cassian again. That calculating look. "So here I am. A traitor by intent if not by action. Awaiting your judgment."

King Aldric was quiet for a long moment. Then he turned to Cassian. "You said you understand trade. Tell me—is this man telling the truth?"

All eyes turned to Cassian. He felt the weight of the question. Felt the coin warm against his chest.

He focused on Corvan, letting his perception open. Saw the shimmer of value around the man. Saw shame, thick and dark. Saw regret. But also—

Something else. Something hollow.

Cassian frowned. He pushed his perception deeper, trying to understand what he was sensing. The impressions came in fragments, abstractions. *Children. Love. Loss.* But the quality was wrong. Distant. Like hearing music through a wall.

He interpreted: Corvan loves his children. He's terrified of losing them. That's real.

"He's telling the truth," Cassian said. "He made the trade. He regrets it. The guilt is genuine."

Relief flickered across several faces. Even Corvan looked grateful.

But something nagged at Cassian. Something about those impressions. The way they felt hollow, distant. Like they'd been...

No. That was his bias speaking. He wanted to see corruption everywhere now, after what the Dealer had told him. But Corvan's guilt was real. His regret was real. Cassian could see that clearly.

"Your Majesty," Corvan said suddenly. "If I may—I have a proposal."

The King gestured for him to continue.

"I am guilty. I know what I've done. I deserve whatever punishment you decree." Corvan straightened despite his bound hands. "But I also possess information about Draven's plans. His military movements. His methods. Information that could save thousands of lives."

"You'll give us this information," the general said. "We'll extract it if necessary."

"You could try," Corvan said calmly. "But I've been trained to resist interrogation. You'd get nothing useful before I died from the strain." He looked at Cassian. "But him—the coin-bearer—he trades, doesn't he? Values for values. Information for..." He paused. "For mercy."

"What kind of mercy?" the King asked warily.

Corvan's voice was very quiet. "I am to be executed. I accept that. But before I die, I want..." He swallowed hard. "I want to forget my children's faces. I don't want to go to my death seeing them in my mind. Remembering what I've lost. What I've betrayed. If I must die a traitor, at least let me die without that particular agony."

Shock rippled through the council.

"That's monstrous," someone said. "To forget your own children—"

"It's just," Corvan interrupted. "I betrayed them when I made that trade with Draven. I betrayed everything they believed I was. I don't deserve to remember their love." He looked at Cassian. "Can you do it? Can you take those memories from me? In exchange for everything I know about the Hollow's plans?"

Cassian's mouth went dry. Trade memories? He'd only seen that done once—by the Dealer, in that ancient marketplace beneath the earth. The Dealer had ripped his mother's face from his mind with terrible precision. But that was different. The Dealer was... something else. Something ancient and powerful.

Could Cassian do the same?

He reached for the coin's perception, trying to sense Corvan's memories the way the Dealer had sensed his. The impressions came—*children, love, loss*—but they were abstract, distant. He could see their value but not their shape. Not their substance. Like trying to grasp smoke.

"I don't know," Cassian admitted. "I've never—the only time I've seen this done was by someone far more powerful than me. I don't know if I can—"

"Try," Corvan said desperately. "Please. I need this. And you need to know what I know."

Cassian looked at the King, uncertain. King Aldric studied both men carefully.

"Can you do this?" the King asked.

"I..." Cassian gripped the coin tighter. Felt its warmth. Felt something else too—a presence, almost like the coin was aware, watching. Waiting. "I can try. The coin allows me to perceive value, to broker trades. Memories are a form of value. If both parties agree, if the exchange is..." He struggled for words. "If the trade is fair, the coin should facilitate it. But I've never attempted anything like this before."

"What if it goes wrong?" Herrick asked sharply.

"Then I might damage his mind. Or my own." Cassian's voice was steady despite his fear. "Or the trade might simply fail. I don't know."

The council erupted in protests. Too dangerous. Too uncertain. Too much risk.

But King Aldric raised a hand. "Lord Corvan—you understand the risks?"

"Yes, Your Majesty."

"And you still wish to proceed?"

"I do."

The King was silent for a long moment. Then he nodded. "Make the trade. If it succeeds, Lord Corvan receives a quick death. If it fails..." He looked at Cassian. "We'll discuss consequences then."

Cassian's hands were shaking as he stood. This was insane. He had no idea what he was doing. But the council was watching, and Corvan was waiting, and somewhere in the man's mind was information that could save thousands of lives.

The guards cleared a space. Cassian approached Corvan slowly. Up close, he could see the exhaustion etched in the man's face. The resignation. The guilt eating away at him.

"Are you certain?" Cassian asked quietly. "I'm pretty sure we can't undo this."

"I'm certain." Corvan met his gaze. "Take them. Take the memories of my children's faces. Their voices. Everything that made them mine. And in return, I'll give you everything I know about Draven Kane."

Cassian nodded, though his heart was racing. He pressed the coin between his palms, focusing. The warmth built—hotter than usual, almost burning. He reached out with his perception, trying to do what the Dealer had done to him.

Finding the threads of memory in Corvan's mind was like reaching into fog. He could sense them—impressions of *children, faces, love*—but they were indistinct. Blurred. He pushed deeper, trying to grasp them the way the Dealer had grasped his mother's face.

The coin grew scorching hot in his hands. Cassian gasped but didn't let go. He could feel something shifting—the coin responding to his intent, to both parties' agreement. The trade was balanced. Both sides willing. The coin *should* facilitate it.

He pulled the thread of Corvan's memories with his mind's eye.

The transfer was violent. Chaotic. Nothing like the quick extraction the Dealer had performed. Memories ripped from Corvan like pages torn from a book—jagged, incomplete. Faces appeared in Cassian's mind—two daughters, a son—but they were fragmentary, distorted. Their features kept shifting, refusing to solidify.

Children he'd never met, but who now lived in his thoughts like ghosts. Voices calling "Papa" but the sound was wrong, echoing, hollow.

And in exchange, information poured back—but it was raw, unorganized. Military positions tangled with personal memories. Supply lines mixed with emotions. Everything Corvan knew about Draven spilling out in a chaotic flood.

It took perhaps thirty seconds. When it ended, both men staggered.

Cassian caught himself on the table's edge, gasping. Pain lanced through his skull. The new memories were wrong—invasive and incomplete at the same time. Children that weren't his but felt like they should be, except their faces kept slipping away. Love that belonged to someone else pressing into his mind like a thorn.

Corvan collapsed. Guards caught him before he hit the floor. His eyes were unfocused, mouth slack. For a terrifying moment, Cassian thought he'd broken the man's mind entirely.

Corvan swayed, blank-faced for a moment. Then his eyes focused slowly. "Did it work?"

"Yes," Cassian managed, though he wasn't sure if that was true. Something had happened. But whether he'd done it right...

"What did I trade? Children? Do I have children?" Corvan asked. His voice was distant, confused.

"You did," the King said quietly. "But you won't remember them now."

Corvan nodded slowly, mechanically. "Good. That's... that's good." He looked around the room like he was seeing it for the first time. "What did I agree to tell you about?"

"Draven's plans," Herrick prompted.

"Oh. Yes." Corvan's voice dry. Soulless. "His main force will approach from the east, as expected. But he's sent a smaller force around to the north—they'll strike at the supply depots outside the city walls while the main army engages at the eastern gates. A two-pronged assault. He expects you'll fortify the eastern approach, so he's already planned the northern strike as his primary objective."

The general was scribbling notes frantically. "How large is the northern force?"

"Perhaps three thousand. Mixed infantry and cavalry. They'll hit tomorrow night, under new moon. Dark enough to approach undetected."

"Tomorrow?" The general looked up sharply. "That's impossibly fast. Our scouts would have—"

"Your scouts are compromised," Corvan said flatly. "Or dead. He's been moving forces for weeks. You just haven't seen them."

The general's face darkened. He looked at the King. "Your Majesty, we can't take this intelligence at face value. This could be disinformation. If we redeploy forces to the north and leave the eastern approach vulnerable—"

"It could be a trap," another commander agreed. "We'd be dividing our strength based on a traitor's word."

"But if it's true and we ignore it," Herrick said, "we lose our supply lines. The siege becomes unwinnable."

The King held up a hand. "Send scouts. Quietly. Have them verify what they can about northern movements. But also reinforce the eastern walls as planned—we can't leave them exposed." He looked at the general. "How long until we know if this intelligence is accurate?"

"If there's a force of three thousand moving through the northern approach? We should be able to confirm or deny it by dawn tomorrow. If they're not there—"

"Then we know Lord Corvan was fed false information," the King finished. "Or is still playing us." He looked at the prisoner. "In which case, his death will not be quick."

Corvan didn't react. Just stood there, empty-eyed, as guards prepared to lead him back to the dungeon.

The council erupted in tactical arguments. Should they trust the intelligence? How to deploy forces without leaving any approach vulnerable? What if it was all misdirection?

Cassian barely heard them. He was still processing what he'd taken—or what he'd tried to take. The memories wouldn't settle properly in his mind. They kept shifting, refusing to integrate. Like trying to hold water in his bare hands.

Something was wrong. Had he done it wrong? Or was there something wrong with the memories themselves?

He focused on one of the girls' faces. Tried to see her clearly. But the image was blurry. Indistinct. Not like a real memory but like a copy of a copy. The emotional weight was there—love, fierce and protective—but the actual details kept slipping away.

*Hollow*, something whispered in his mind. *They're hollow.*

Cassian's stomach dropped.

He looked at Corvan, who stood quietly as guards prepared to lead him back to the dungeon. The man looked almost peaceful now. Unburdened. But there was nothing behind his eyes. Nothing at all.

Had Cassian taken memories that were already corrupted? Already hollow? Or had he simply extracted them badly, damaging them in the process? He didn't know. Couldn't know. The Dealer had made it look effortless. Cassian had nearly torn both their minds apart trying to replicate it.

Either way, the result was the same: the memories were wrong.

And Cassian had accepted it as fair trade—or tried to.

The coin had accepted it too, facilitating the exchange. Because technically, Corvan *had* given him memories of his children. But they were worthless. Incomplete. Either corrupted by Draven years ago, or mangled by Cassian's poor extraction.

Worse—Cassian could feel them now, settling into his mind like rot. The hollow memories were wrong in a way he couldn't articulate. Something cold and distant touching his thoughts, marking him.

*Did Draven know this would happen?* Cassian wondered. *Did Corvan know? Was this the plan all along?*

*He knows where you are now*, a voice seemed to whisper.

Cassian wanted to scream. To warn everyone. But the King was frowning thoughtfully, the council was debating verification methods, and guards were leading Corvan away.

"Master Cassian," King Aldric said, his voice cutting through the arguments. "That was... disturbing to witness. Are you well?"

Cassian forced himself to nod. "The trade was more difficult than I expected, Your Majesty. I've never attempted anything like that before."

"That was apparent." The King studied him carefully. "The information Corvan provided—do you believe it's accurate?"

"I..." Cassian hesitated. "I received something from him. Intelligence, memories, all tangled together. But I can't guarantee its accuracy. He could have been fed false information before he returned. Or..." He struggled with how much to admit. "Or the memories themselves could have been corrupted somehow. I don't know enough to say for certain."

The general grunted. "At least he's honest about it. We'll verify what we can through scouts. If the intelligence proves false, we'll know tomorrow."

"And if it proves true," Herrick said quietly, "then despite the... irregularity... Master Cassian may have just saved the city."

"We'll see," King Aldric said. "Master Cassian, you've given us much to consider. Both about the Hollow's methods and your own abilities. You've earned a place in this court—but also earned considerable scrutiny." His eyes were hard. "Don't make me regret allowing you to keep that coin."

He'd been played. Or he'd played himself. Or maybe both.

Corvan had given him exactly what he asked for—memories and intelligence. But the memories were either corrupted or mangled in the extraction. And the intelligence, while it might be accurate, could just as easily be bait. Leading Cassian and the King's forces exactly where Draven wanted them to go.

And through those wrong, hollow, broken memories, Draven might now know exactly where Cassian was. What he was doing. Maybe even what he was planning.

Or maybe Cassian had simply failed at something he had no business attempting. Maybe he'd damaged both their minds trying to replicate what only the Dealer could do safely.

Either way, he'd won the negotiation but lost something in the process. His certainty. His confidence. The belief that he knew what he was doing.

The council session ended with plans being made, orders being issued. The general left to deploy forces to defend the northern supply depots. Nobles rushed off to secure their estates. Scholars hurried to consult old texts about defensive siege craft.

Cassian was led to a side chamber where Lord Herrick waited with two clerks.

"The King wants a full report," Herrick said. "Everything you know about the Hollow's methods. Everything you learned from that trade. We'll need it documented for the war archives."

Cassian spent two hours dictating what he knew, what he'd seen, what he'd learned. He left out the part about the memories being hollow. Left out his suspicion that he'd been manipulated. He needed time to think. To understand what he'd done.

When he finally emerged from the palace, evening had fallen. The city streets were quieter now, shops closing early, people retreating to their homes. Tomorrow the Hollow's northern force would strike. Tomorrow the battle would begin.

Cassian walked aimlessly through the upper city, his mind churning. The hollow memories whispered at the edge of his consciousness. Children's faces he couldn't quite see. Voices he couldn't quite hear. And beneath it all, something watching. Waiting.

He found himself near the palace gardens, in a small square with a fountain that no longer ran. A few vendors remained, packing up their stalls for the night. And there, sitting on the fountain's edge, was a woman.

She was perhaps twenty, with dark hair pulled back in a practical braid and clothes that suggested travel—sturdy boots, a worn cloak, a pack beside her. She was eating an apple and watching the last of the evening light fade from the sky.

When she saw Cassian, she smiled.

"You look like you've had a terrible day," she said.

Cassian almost kept walking. He wasn't in the mood for conversation. But something about her smile was genuine. Warm. The first honest expression he'd seen all day.

"You could say that," he replied.

"Join me?" She gestured to the fountain's edge. "I hate eating alone."

Against his better judgment, Cassian sat. The woman offered him a piece of bread from her pack. He accepted, suddenly realizing he hadn't eaten since morning.

They sat in comfortable silence for a moment. Then the woman spoke.

"You're the one everyone's talking about, aren't you? The coin-bearer who exposed Lord Corvan?"

Cassian stiffened. "News travels fast."

"It does in this city. Especially when it involves the King's court and treason." She took another bite of apple. "I'm Mira, by the way. Merchant. Or I was, before the roads became too dangerous to travel."

"Cassian."

"I know." She smiled again. "Like I said, everyone's talking about you. The ledger-keeper from nowhere who can trade anything for anything. They say you took a traitor's memories right out of his head."

"Something like that." Cassian's voice was flat.

Mira studied him. "But it didn't go the way you expected, did it?"

He looked at her sharply. "What makes you say that?"

"Because you're sitting on a fountain looking like you want to throw yourself into it. That's not the face of someone celebrating a victory." She finished her apple, tossed the core into a nearby garden bed. "Want to talk about it?"

"Not particularly."

"Fair enough." She stood, brushing crumbs from her lap. "But if you change your mind, I'm staying at the River's Rest. The inn near the docks. Room seven." She shouldered her pack. "I've had my share of bad trades too. Sometimes it helps to talk to someone who understands."

She started to walk away. Then she paused, looking back.

"For what it's worth," she said quietly, "you're trying to do the right thing. That matters. Even when it goes wrong."

Then she was gone, disappearing into the evening crowd.

Cassian sat alone by the fountain. The hollow memories whispered in his mind. Somewhere in the city, Draven's forces were positioning for tomorrow's attack. Somewhere in the palace, another fragment waited to be found.

And somewhere, his enemy was watching through the poisoned memories Cassian had been foolish enough to accept.

He touched the coin in his pocket. Still warm. Still pulsing with that strange life.

*You're not as clever as you thought,* he told himself.

But maybe he could learn. Maybe he could get better. Smarter. Maybe next time—

A scream cut through the evening air.

Cassian was on his feet immediately, running toward the sound. Others were running too—toward the southern gates. Toward the refugee camps outside the walls.

Fire. He could see it now, rising in orange columns against the darkening sky. Not just one fire. Dozens. The camps were burning.

And cutting through the smoke and screams, a sound that made his blood run cold: laughter. Calm. Empty. Hollow.

The attack wasn't coming tomorrow.

It was coming now.
