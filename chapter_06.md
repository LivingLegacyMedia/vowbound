# Chapter 6: Arvenstead

The journey to the capital took five days through autumn rain and roads churned to mud. Cassian pushed the old mare harder than was wise, sleeping in barns when he slept at all. His father's journals stayed wrapped in oiled cloth at the bottom of his pack, their contents consuming his thoughts.

*The fragments know each other,* the Dealer had said. *Find the others before he does.*

By the third day, the coin grew feverish against his chest, pulsing with heat that had nothing to do with his body temperature. Something was near. Another fragment, perhaps. Or Draven himself.

Every morning, Cassian woke reaching for his mother's face and found only emptiness. The loss was getting easier to bear—which somehow made it worse. He was learning to live with the absence, learning to function with a piece of himself carved out. That was the true weight of the Dealer's price: not the initial agony, but the slow normalization of grief.

---

The capital of Arvenstead rose from the plains like a gray tooth, all stone walls and crowded towers pressed together behind battlements that had stood for three hundred years. Cassian had been here once as a child, when his father still had money for such trips. He remembered markets that stretched for blocks, merchants speaking a dozen languages, the King's palace rising white and gold above the city like a second sun.

Now, refugee camps sprawled outside the walls. Thousands of displaced families lived in tents and lean-tos, their smoke rising in thin columns against the autumn sky. Guards patrolled the main gates, turning away more people than they admitted. The city was full. The city was afraid.

The guard at the South Gate barely glanced at the summons before waving Cassian through with a snort. "Palace is in the upper city. Good luck getting in. They're turning away half the petitioners these days."

Cassian led his horse through the gate and into a city transformed by fear.

---

The markets were subdued, merchants selling their wares quietly. People moved with their heads down, hurrying. No one lingered. But on every corner, on every market square, someone was preaching.

Hollow converts.

They stood on boxes and crates, speaking in calm, measured voices about peace and freedom from suffering. Small crowds gathered to listen—drawn by curiosity or desperation, Cassian couldn't tell.

"Trade your debts for deliverance," one of them said. A woman in her thirties, hollow-eyed but smiling. "I once carried the weight of seven children I couldn't feed. Sleepless nights. Hungry cries. The guilt of every empty belly. The Hollow took it all. Now I sleep soundly. Now I am free. You can be free too."

A young man beside her nodded. "I lost my legs in the war. The pain was unbearable. Every morning, waking to agony. Every night, praying for death. The Hollow offered me a trade: my memories of walking, for freedom from suffering. I accepted. I am hollow, yes. But I am also finally at peace."

People in the crowd murmured. Some looked horrified. Others looked tempted.

Cassian watched, his chest tight. They weren't lying. They had traded their pain for emptiness, and to them, the bargain was fair. Looking at the woman's smile, the young man's calm—it *was* a kind of peace. A disturbing peace, but peace nonetheless.

An old merchant near Cassian shook his head. "Used to be you could tell who was hollow just by looking at them. Now they smile. They laugh. They almost seem normal."

"Have many people accepted?" Cassian asked quietly.

"More every day. Whole families sometimes. The Hollow take your suffering, and these days, who doesn't have suffering to spare?" The merchant spat on the cobblestones. "Me, I'd rather hurt than be empty. But I'm old. Ask me again when the pain gets worse."

Cassian moved on, but the preachers were everywhere. In the market square, a hollow woman spoke to a crowd of perhaps fifty people. In an alley, two hollow men helped an elderly couple who'd just accepted the trade, their eyes already beginning to empty. Outside a tavern, a young girl distributed contracts to those willing to listen.

The contracts. Seeing them in person made Cassian's stomach turn. Formal documents, meticulously written, offering to take suffering in exchange for service. Sign one, and your pain ends. Sign one, and you become a vessel for someone else's debts.

He thought of Millhaven. The refugees who'd arrived with hollow eyes. The magistrate who'd probably already signed the contracts by now. Everyone he'd known—widow Marta, the merchants, the neighbors—probably hollow now because he'd left them to save themselves the only way available.

The guilt settled onto his shoulders like a physical weight.

He found lodging at a tavern called the Broken Wheel, near the docks. Cheaper than the inns closer to the palace, and busy enough that no one would pay attention to another travel-worn stranger. He paid what little money he had left for a narrow room with a single window and a bed that smelled of must and old straw.

The palace would have to wait until morning. The King's summons said he should present himself "at the earliest convenience," but Cassian was exhausted, filthy, and the coin was burning against his chest like a brand. He needed to rest. To think. To prepare for whatever came next.

He came back downstairs as evening fell, drawn by the smell of stew and the low murmur of conversation. The common room was half-full—merchants, travelers, a few city guards off duty. He found a corner table and ordered food.

The stew was thin but hot. He ate mechanically, watching the room. Most people kept their heads down, speaking in low voices. No one wanted to draw attention. But at a table near the fire, a woman sat alone, writing in a ledger.

She was perhaps twenty, with dark hair pulled back in a practical braid. Travel-worn clothes—sturdy boots, a worn cloak, a pack at her feet. She had an apple and a cup of wine, and she worked with the focused intensity of someone trying to solve an impossible problem.

Every few minutes, she'd stop, stare at something in the ledger, then shake her head and cross something out.

Cassian found himself watching her. There was something about her expression—frustration mixed with determination—that reminded him of himself. Of countless nights spent over his father's ledgers, trying to make impossible numbers add up to something that made sense.

She looked up suddenly and caught him watching. He looked away quickly, but not quickly enough.

"You're staring," she said. Her voice was clear, direct. Not hostile, just stating a fact.

"Sorry. You looked frustrated. It's a feeling I know well."

"Do you." She studied him for a moment. "Let me guess—merchant? No, too poor. Messenger? Close, but not quite." Her eyes narrowed. "Ledger-keeper. You have that look. Like you see numbers in everything."

Despite himself, Cassian smiled. "That obvious?"

"It takes one to know one." She gestured to the empty chair across from her. "I'm Mira. And I'm trying to figure out if I can afford to stay in this city another three days or if I need to give up and go home."

Cassian hesitated, then moved to her table. Up close, he could see dark circles under her eyes. The kind that came from worry, not just exhaustion.

"Cassian. And I'd help if I could, but I can barely afford this room myself."

"Not asking for help. Just commiserating." She closed the ledger with a sigh. "What brings you to the capital? Besides poverty."

"The King's summons. He's looking for advisors."

Mira's eyebrows rose. "You answered the summons? Most people ignored it. Figured it was desperate propaganda." She studied him more carefully. "What makes you qualified to advise a king?"

"I understand how the Hollow works. How they trade. What they're really offering people."

Something shifted in her expression. Interest. And something else—hope? Fear?

"You've studied them?" She leaned forward. "The Hollow. You know how their bargains work?"

"I've seen the aftermath. I've spoken with refugees. I've—" He hesitated. "I've learned things about the mechanics of exchange that most people don't know."

"Can they be undone?" The question came out urgent. Too urgent. She caught herself, sat back. "Sorry. I just... I'm looking for someone. My brother. He was taken by the Hollow."

Cassian's chest tightened. "How long ago?"

"Three weeks." Her voice was quiet now. Raw. "He was brilliant, my brother. Wanted to help people. But he failed. Alot, actually. His ideas didn't always work. When our mother died two months ago, he just... broke. Spent weeks staring at walls, crying. I tried everything. Nothing helped."

She took a shaky breath. "Then the Hollow came to our city. Draven Kane himself was there—leading the advance. He walked through the streets like he owned them, talking to people. And he saw Torin. Saw his grief. He offered him a trade personally: his grief, his guilt, his memories of watching her die—all of it gone. In exchange for his service. He gave Torin a golden locket. Told him exactly what it would do. 'Open this, and your suffering ends. You'll be free.'"

"Draven gave it to him directly?" Cassian asked quietly, understanding the significance. The locket—the imprisoned coin. Not a contract like the emissaries usually distributed. Draven himself had chosen Torin for something.

"Yes. I didn't understand why at the time. There were hundreds of desperate people, but Draven chose my brother." Her voice dropped. "Maybe he saw something in him. Some potential. I don't know."

"He knew what would happen. He held that locket for three days. I begged him not to open it. But he said..." Her voice broke. "'I can't carry this anymore, Mira. I'm drowning. At least if I'm hollow, I won't feel this pain.' And he opened it." 

She wiped her eyes with the back of her hand. "I watched the life drain out of his eyes. Everything that made him Torin just... gone. Replaced by calm, empty nothing. He hugged me goodbye like I was a stranger he vaguely recognized. Then they took him."

Cassian didn't know what to say. He'd seen that same emptiness in the preachers on the streets. That same terrible peace.

"People say," Mira continued, gripping her cup, "that the newly hollow aren't fully gone yet. Not completely. That if you can reach them quickly enough, within the first month or two, there might be a way to bring them back. That's why I'm here. Why I'm searching. But I'm running out of time. And money. And hope."

"Where do you think he is?"

"I don't know. I've been tracking Hollow movements, interrogating refugees. Someone mentioned they saw newly converted being taken northeast. Another said there's a fortress where they keep them during..." She swallowed. "During the transition. But I don't have confirmation. Just rumors. And every day I waste chasing false leads is another day Torin slips further away."

Cassian looked at her—really looked at her. Saw the desperation. The determination. The exhaustion of someone who'd been fighting alone for too long.

"Can you help him?" she asked. "With what you know?"

"I don't know," Cassian admitted. "I'm still learning. Still figuring out how it all works. But if there's a way..." He thought about the coin in his pocket. About the Dealer's words. About everything he'd sacrificed to get here. "If there's a way to undo what they've done, I'll find it."

Something like relief flickered across her face. "Thank you. Just... thank you for not telling me it's impossible."

They sat in silence for a moment. Then Mira seemed to shake herself.

"So. You're going to the palace tomorrow?"

"That's the plan."

"Word of advice—the court is more dangerous than you think. Everyone there has an agenda. The nobles will see you as a threat or a tool, nothing in between. The military will want to control you. And the King..." She paused. "They say he's desperate. Desperate men make dangerous decisions."

"You seem to know a lot about the court for a merchant."

"I asked questions. Listened to gossip. When you're tracking someone, you learn to gather information quickly." She finished her wine. "Just be careful. Don't trust anyone who offers you easy answers. And don't accept any trades without thinking them through completely."

"Sound advice."

"I've learned it the hard way." She stood, shouldering her pack. "I'm in room seven if you need anything. Or if you learn something that might help me find Torin."

"Where will you be tomorrow?"

"Asking more questions. Chasing more rumors. Same as every other day." She managed a tired smile. "Good luck with the King. Try not to let him throw you in the dungeon."

"I'll do my best."

She left, and Cassian sat alone at the table. The common room was emptying now, people retreating to their rooms. Outside, the city was settling into an uneasy night.

---

That night, Cassian dreamed.

Not of his mother—those dreams were impossible now, her face erased from memory. Instead, he dreamed of the old marketplace beneath the earth. The Dealer standing in darkness, void-eyes watching.

**"You paid the price,"** the Dealer's voice echoed through the stone chamber. **"Now you must learn what you bought."**

The scene shifted. Cassian saw a city—not Arvenstead, but somewhere older. In the city square, a man stood on a platform. Young. Handsome. Wearing fine clothes and holding something golden in his palm.

Draven.

"I offer you freedom," dream-Draven said, his voice carrying across the square. "Freedom from your suffering. From your debts. From your shame. All I ask is a simple trade—your pain for my peace."

He held up a golden locket. Beautiful. Terrible.

"Open this, and your suffering ends. All of it. I promise you—no tricks, no deception. You will feel nothing. And feeling nothing is better than feeling what you feel now. Isn't it?"

The crowd surged forward. Desperate. Eager. One by one, people opened the locket. One by one, Cassian watched the light fade from their eyes. Watched them become empty vessels, smiling and calm and hollow.

And Draven smiled. Not with cruelty, but with satisfaction. Like a merchant completing a successful transaction.

Like Cassian himself when a difficult trade finally balanced.

The dream shifted. Now he saw Mira's brother—Torin—holding the locket. Three days of holding it, turning it over in his hands. And then, finally, opening it. The light draining from his eyes. His sister screaming—

**"He is coming,"** the Dealer's voice cut through the vision. **"He seeks what you seek. Find it first, or all you have sacrificed will be for nothing."**

"Can he be defeated?" Cassian asked the darkness.

**"No. Not by you. Not alone."** A pause. **"But you already knew that, didn't you? That's why you offered to help the girl in the tavern. Why you accepted the guild member's summons. Why you'll promise the King what he wants to hear. You tell yourself it's compassion. But every connection you make serves your purpose. You're collecting allies."**

"That's not—I'm just trying to help them"

**"Are you?"** The Dealer's void-eyes seemed to bore into him. **"The girl wants her brother back. You want information about the Hollow. The King wants victory. You want the fragment. Everyone trades. Everyone pays. The only question is whether you'll admit that your help always has a price—even if you don't say it aloud."**

The darkness pressed closer.

**"Tomorrow you will make trades you think are fair. You will take what you need and tell yourself it was necessary. Just like he does."** A terrible pause. **"The difference between you and Draven Kane is thinner than you think. You both understand bargains. You both know how to find what people want most. The only difference is how you use that knowledge—and how long until desperation erodes whatever principle you think separates you from him."**

"No," Cassian said. "I'm nothing like him."

**"Then prove it. When the time comes, when you hold power over someone desperate—when you could extract anything from them because they need what you offer—prove you're different. Prove the coin chose better with you."**

The Dealer began to fade.

**"Because if you don't, then I made a very poor trade twenty-three years ago when I helped your father find that coin."**

Cassian woke gasping, sweat-soaked. Dawn light crept through the window. The coin was cool against his chest, but the dream's words remained.

*The difference between you and Draven Kane is smaller than you think.*

He tried to push the thought away. He was nothing like Draven. He helped people. He tried to make fair trades. He—

But the Dealer's question remained: *Or are you trading their desperation for your own purposes?*

He thought of Mira. Her desperate hope. His promise to help find a way to save her brother.

He'd meant it when he said it. But was he helping her? Or was he using her grief to gain an ally? Someone who knew the city, who had information, who could be useful?

The line between help and exploitation felt thinner than it had yesterday.

Cassian dressed slowly, strapping his father's journals into his pack. The coin went into his pocket, heavy and warm. He looked at himself in the cracked mirror above the washbasin. Same face. Same eyes. But something had changed.

He was going to the palace today. To advise the King. To gain access to records and fragments and power. And every step felt like walking deeper into a web he didn't fully understand.

*Just don't become what you're fighting,* he told himself.

But the Dealer's voice whispered back: *Too late. You already are. The question is how far you'll go.*

---

He found bread and weak tea in the common room. No sign of Mira. She was probably already out questioning refugees, chasing rumors, desperately searching for a brother who was slipping further away with every passing hour.

Cassian tried not to think about whether he could actually help her. About whether he'd made a promise he couldn't keep.

The palace stood at the city's highest point, its white stone walls gilded by morning sun. Guards in formal dress lined the approach—twice as many as normal, Cassian guessed. Security was tight. The kingdom was preparing for war.

He joined the line of petitioners, scholars, and supposed advisors. All answering the King's summons. All claiming they could help. The guards processed them slowly, checking credentials, asking questions, turning away anyone suspicious.

When Cassian's turn came, he presented the summons. The guard studied it carefully.

"Ledger-keeper from Millhaven. Says here you have knowledge of the Hollow's methods."

"I do."

"Prove it."

Cassian chose his words carefully. "The Hollow doesn't conquer. It offers. Every person who becomes hollow makes a choice. They trade away suffering in exchange for emptiness. It's voluntary. That's what makes it so effective—people willingly accept their loss."

The guard's expression shifted. "How do you know this?"

"Because I've seen it. I've seen the contracts they sign. I've spoken with refugees who barely escaped." He met the guard's gaze. "And I know exploitation when I see it."

The guard studied him for a long moment. Then he nodded. "Wait here."

Ten minutes later, a palace official arrived—a thin man in expensive clothes who introduced himself as Lord Herrick, the King's chamberlain. He looked Cassian up and down with obvious distaste.

"You're the ledger-keeper?"

"I am."

"The council meets this afternoon. You'll present your knowledge then." His eyes were cold. "If your information proves false or worthless, you'll wish you'd stayed in your village."

Herrick turned and walked back toward the palace, clearly expecting Cassian to follow.

The gates swung open.

Cassian touched the coin in his pocket one last time. It was burning now, almost painful against his skin. Another fragment was close. Very close.

He thought of Mira, somewhere in the city, searching for a brother who might be beyond saving.

He thought of Millhaven, probably hollow by now because he'd abandoned them.

He thought of the Dealer's words: *The difference between you and Draven Kane is smaller than you think.*

Then he stepped through the gates and into a world where every word, every gesture, every trade could mean the difference between salvation and damnation.

The palace swallowed him whole.

Behind him, the gates closed with a sound like a tomb sealing shut.

And in the city below, the Hollow preachers continued their work, offering peace to the desperate and freedom to the suffering, one deal at a time.
