# Chapter 6: Arvenstead

The journey to the capital took five days through autumn rain and roads churned to mud. Cassian pushed the old mare harder than was wise, sleeping in barns when he slept at all. His father's journals stayed wrapped in oiled cloth at the bottom of his pack, their contents consuming his thoughts.

*The fragments know each other,* the Dealer had said. *Find the others before he does.*

Every morning, Cassian woke reaching for his mother's face and found only emptiness. The loss was getting easier to bear—which somehow made it worse. He was learning to live with the absence, learning to function with a piece of himself carved out. That was the true weight of the Dealer's price: not the initial agony, but the slow normalization of grief.

On the fourth day, he passed a refugee family camped beside the road—a father, mother, and three children huddled beneath a makeshift shelter of canvas and branches. The father watched Cassian ride past with the particular stillness of someone who'd already lost everything that mattered.

Cassian wanted to stop. To offer something. But he had barely enough coins left for lodging in the capital, and the family needed more than he could give. He rode on, their hollow stares following him down the road.

*What would you have traded to save them?* he found himself thinking. *What price would be fair?*

He didn't like that the question came so easily now. Didn't like how naturally he'd begun thinking in terms of exchange—suffering weighed against salvation, mercy measured in cost. The Dealer's bargain had taught him to see value everywhere. But some things, he told himself, shouldn't require payment.

By the time Millhaven was three days behind him, the guilt had settled in properly. Widow Marta. Master Grenn. All the people he'd corrected taxes for, thinking he was helping them. Had they signed the contracts by now? Had the Hollow offered them peace, and had they accepted it because there was no other choice?

He'd left them. Chased his own purpose. And if they'd become hollow in his absence, that was another debt he owed—one he couldn't calculate in his ledgers.

---

The capital of Arvenstead rose from the plains like a gray tooth, all stone walls and crowded towers pressed together behind battlements that had stood for three hundred years. Cassian had been here once as a child, when his father still had money for such trips. He remembered markets that stretched for blocks, merchants speaking a dozen languages, the King's palace rising white and gold above the city like a second sun.

Now, refugee camps sprawled outside the walls. Thousands of displaced families lived in tents and lean-tos, their smoke rising in thin columns against the autumn sky. Guards patrolled the main gates, turning away more people than they admitted. The city was full. The city was afraid.

The guard at the South Gate barely glanced at the summons before waving Cassian through with a snort. "Palace is in the upper city. Good luck getting in. They're turning away half the petitioners these days."

Cassian led his horse through the gate and into a city transformed by fear.

---

The markets were subdued, merchants selling their wares quietly. People moved with their heads down, hurrying. No one lingered. But in the central square, a small crowd gathered around a woman standing on a crate.

A hollow convert.

She spoke in a calm, measured voice, but there was an unsettling brightness to her delivery—like someone reciting lines they'd memorized perfectly. "I once carried the weight of seven children I couldn't feed. Sleepless nights. Hungry cries. The guilt of every empty belly pressing down on me until I couldn't breathe." She smiled. "The Hollow took it all. Now I sleep soundly. Now I am free. You can be free too."

A man in the crowd—gaunt, desperate—called out: "But what do you feel now? Anything?"

"Peace," she said simply. "Isn't that what we all want?"

People in the crowd murmured. Some looked horrified. Others looked tempted.

Cassian watched from the edge of the gathering, his chest tight. She wasn't lying. She had traded her pain for emptiness, and to her, the bargain was fair. Looking at her smile, her calm—it *was* a kind of peace. A disturbing peace, but peace nonetheless.

An old merchant near Cassian shook his head. "Used to be you could tell who was hollow just by looking at them. Now they smile. They laugh. They almost seem normal."

"How many have accepted?" Cassian asked quietly.

"More every day. Whole families sometimes." The merchant spat on the cobblestones. "Me, I'd rather hurt than be empty. But I'm old. Ask me again after the pain worsens."

Cassian moved on. At the corner, he saw a young girl distributing contracts to passersby—formal documents offering to take suffering in exchange for service. Most people hurried past. A few stopped to read, their faces drawn with desperation.

Sign it, and your pain ends. Sign it, and you become a vessel for someone else's debts.

He found lodging at a tavern called the Broken Wheel, near the docks—a common stop for those seeking audience with the King, where lodging was cheap and questions were scarce. He counted out his remaining coins carefully: just enough for three nights and meals, with nothing left over. The room was narrow, with a single window and a bed that smelled of must and old straw, but it would do.

The palace would have to wait until morning. The King's summons said he should present himself "at the earliest convenience," but Cassian was exhausted, filthy, and the coin was burning against his chest like a brand. He needed to rest. To think. To prepare for whatever came next.

He came back downstairs as evening fell, drawn by the smell of stew and the low murmur of conversation. The common room was half-full—merchants, travelers, a few city guards off duty. He found a corner table and ordered food.

The stew was thin but hot. He ate mechanically, watching the room. Most people kept their heads down, speaking in low voices. No one wanted to draw attention. But at a table near the fire, a woman sat alone, writing in a ledger with the focused intensity of someone fighting a losing battle.

She was perhaps twenty, with dark hair pulled back in a practical braid. Travel-worn clothes—sturdy boots, a worn cloak, a pack at her feet. She had an apple and a cup of wine, and every few minutes she'd stop, stare at something she'd written, then shake her head and cross it out.

Cassian found himself watching her. There was something about her expression—frustration mixed with determination—that felt familiar. Like looking in a mirror that reflected struggles instead of faces.

She looked up suddenly and caught him watching. He looked away quickly, but not quickly enough.

"You're staring," she said. Her voice was clear, direct. Not hostile, just stating a fact.

"Sorry. You looked frustrated. It's a feeling I know well."

"Do you." She studied him for a moment. "Let me guess—merchant? No, too poor. Messenger? Close, but not quite." Her eyes narrowed. "Ledger-keeper. You have that look. Like you see numbers in everything."

Despite himself, Cassian smiled. "That obvious?"

"It takes one to know one." She gestured to the empty chair across from her. "I'm Mira. And I'm trying to figure out if I can afford to stay in this city another three days or if I need to give up and go home."

Cassian hesitated, then moved to her table. Up close, he could see dark circles under her eyes. The kind that came from worry, not just exhaustion.

"Cassian. And I'd help if I could, but I can barely afford this room myself."

"Not asking for help. Just commiserating." She closed the ledger with a sigh, seeming to weigh whether to continue the conversation. After a moment, she spoke again. "What brings you to the capital? Besides poverty."

"The King's summons. He's looking for advisors."

Mira's eyebrows rose. "You answered the summons? Most people ignored it. Figured it was desperate propaganda." She studied him more carefully. "What makes you qualified?"

"I understand how the Hollow works. How they trade. What they're really offering people."

Something shifted in her expression. Interest. And something else—a flash of hope quickly suppressed. "You've studied them?"

"I've seen the aftermath. I've spoken with refugees. I've—" He hesitated. "I've learned things about the mechanics of their bargains that most people don't know."

She was quiet for a long moment, her fingers drumming on the closed ledger. Then: "Can they be undone? The bargains, I mean."

The question was careful. Controlled. There was weight behind it.

"I don't know," Cassian admitted. "Maybe. Why?"

She looked at him, seemed to make a decision. "My brother accepted their offer. Seven weeks ago."

Cassian's chest tightened. "Seven weeks. I'm sorry."

"His name is Torin." Her voice dropped, becoming rawer. "He was always trying to help people, coming up with plans to make things better. Most of them didn't work, but he never stopped trying. When our mother died nine weeks ago, he fell apart. Spent days staring at walls, not eating. I couldn't reach him."

She took a shaky breath. "Then the Hollow came to our city. Draven Kane himself was there—leading the advance. He walked through the streets like he owned them, and he saw Torin. Saw his grief. He offered him a trade personally: all his suffering, all his guilt—gone. In exchange for service. He gave Torin a golden locket. Told him exactly what it would do."

"Draven gave it to him directly?" Cassian asked quietly, understanding the significance. Not a contract like the emissaries distributed. Draven had chosen him.

"Yes. There were hundreds of suffering people, but Draven chose my brother." Her jaw tightened. "Torin held that locket for two days. I begged him not to open it. But he said he was drowning. That at least if he was hollow, he wouldn't hurt anymore." 

She met Cassian's eyes. "I watched everything that made him Torin drain away. The light in his eyes just... went out. Replaced by nothing. By calm, empty nothing. He thanked me for being a good sister. Then he left with them, walking northeast with a group of newly converted, and I haven't seen him since."

"I'm sorry," Cassian said quietly. The words felt inadequate.

"Everyone's sorry." There was no bitterness in her voice, just exhaustion. "But sorry doesn't tell me where he is or how to get him back. I've been tracking their movements for seven weeks. Northeast, always northeast. Someone mentioned a fortress. Someone else said they saw hollow converts being trained for... something. But every lead goes cold. Every trail dead-ends."

"What will you do when you find him?"

"I don't know." She looked down at her ledger, at the crossed-out notes and failed calculations. "I keep thinking—there has to be a way. They took something from him, which means that something still exists. Maybe it can be restored. Maybe..." She trailed off. "Maybe I'm chasing a fantasy because the alternative would break me."

Cassian looked at her—really looked at her. Saw the exhaustion that came from searching alone. The determination that hadn't yet broken. The fear that it might. He thought of his own father, chasing legends everyone else dismissed. The way people had looked at Rowan—with pity, with scorn. The way they'd looked at Cassian for not stopping him.

"It's not a fantasy," he said. "The Hollow works through exchange. They take something and imprison it—store it somewhere. Your brother's emotions, his memories, whatever made him himself—it didn't just vanish. It's being held. Used, maybe. But it exists somewhere."

Mira's eyes widened. "You know this?"

"I know how their system works. Not all of it, but enough to know that what's taken isn't destroyed." He hesitated, then continued. "If there's a way to reverse what they've done, I'll find it. That's part of why I'm here—to understand how their bargains work. The mechanism behind it."

"You'd help me?" Her voice caught. "You don't even know me."

"I know what it's like to watch someone you love chase something everyone else thinks is impossible. And I know what it's like to lose people because you weren't there when they needed you most." He thought of Millhaven. Of all the people he'd left behind. "If I can help you find your brother, if I can help you save him—maybe that counts for something."

"Thank you." Something like relief crossed her face. "Just... thank you for not telling me it's impossible. Most people do."

They sat in silence for a moment. The fire crackled. Outside, rain had begun to fall, pattering against the windows.

"So. You're going to the palace tomorrow?"

"That's the plan."

"Word of advice—the court is more dangerous than you think. Everyone there has an agenda. The nobles will see you as a threat or a tool, nothing in between. The military will want to control you. And the King..." She paused. "They say he's desperate. Desperate men make dangerous decisions."

"You seem to know a lot about the court for a merchant."

"I asked questions. Listened to gossip. When you're tracking someone, you learn to gather information quickly." She finished her wine. "I talked to three different merchants today who'd been to the palace. They all said the same thing—the King is losing control. His advisors are fighting among themselves. Some want to negotiate with the Hollow. Others want to fight. And the King keeps changing his mind about what to do."

"That's not encouraging."

"No, it's not." She stood, shouldering her pack. "Just be careful. Don't trust anyone who offers you easy answers."

"Sound advice. I learned that lesson the hard way already."

Mira paused, studying him. "You made a trade with them, didn't you? The Hollow."

"Not with the Hollow. But I've paid a heavy price for what I know." He didn't elaborate. Some costs were too personal to share with someone he'd just met.

She seemed to accept his answer. "Then you know. You know what it's like to lose something you can't get back."

"I do."

"Good. Then maybe you won't think I'm crazy for going after my brother." She managed a tired smile. "I'm in room seven if you need anything. Or if you learn something at the palace that might help me find Torin."

"Where will you be tomorrow?"

"Asking more questions. Chasing more rumors. Same as every other day." Her smile faded. "Good luck with the King. Try not to let him throw you in the dungeon."

"I'll do my best."

She left, and Cassian sat alone at the table. The common room was emptying now, people retreating to their rooms. Outside, the city was settling into an uneasy night.

---

Cassian dreamed.

Not of his mother—those memories were gone, traded away. Instead, he stood in a city square he didn't recognize. Ancient architecture, weathered stone. In the center, a young man with golden eyes held something bright in his palm.

A young Draven. Before whatever he'd become.

"I can take it from you," dream-Draven said to a woman kneeling before him. She was crying, clutching at his robes. "All your grief. All your shame. You'll never feel it again."

"Please," she whispered.

He opened his hand. Golden light spilled out, wrapped around her like chains made of silk. When it faded, she stood—calm, smiling, empty.

"Thank you," she said. "Thank you for freeing me."

And Draven smiled. Not with cruelty. With satisfaction. Like a merchant after a fair exchange.

The dream began to fragment. Images flashing: the Dealer's void-eyes. His father's journals. The coin burning. Mira searching empty streets. Draven standing over a city of hollow vessels, all of them smiling, all of them thanking him for the freedom he'd given them—

Cassian woke gasping. Dawn light crept through the window. The coin was cool against his chest, but the dream lingered—that image of himself and Draven, both offering bargains, both getting what they wanted.

But there was a difference, he told himself. Draven took everything and gave only emptiness in return. Cassian was trying to find a way to restore what had been taken. To break the system, not exploit it.

*Wasn't he?*

He pushed the uncertainty away and dressed, strapping his father's journals into his pack. The coin went into his pocket. Time to face the King.

---

He found bread and weak tea in the common room. No sign of Mira. She was probably already out questioning refugees, chasing rumors, desperately searching for a brother who was slipping further away with every passing hour.

Cassian tried not to think about whether he could actually help her. About whether he'd made a promise he couldn't keep.

The palace stood at the city's highest point, its white stone walls gilded by morning sun. Guards in formal dress lined the approach—twice as many as normal, Cassian guessed. The kingdom was preparing for war.

He joined the line of petitioners, scholars, and supposed advisors. All answering the King's summons. All claiming they could help. The guards processed them slowly, checking credentials, asking questions, turning away more than they admitted.

When Cassian's turn came, he presented the summons. The guard studied it carefully, then looked up at him with skeptical eyes.

"Ledger-keeper from Millhaven. Says here you have knowledge of the Hollow." He didn't sound impressed. "Everyone claims they understand the Hollow. So far, none of their intel has proved useful to the King's council. What makes you different?"

"I know what they do," Cassian said, "and I understand how it works."

"Enlighten me."

Cassian chose his words carefully. "The Hollow doesn't conquer. It bargains. Every person who becomes hollow makes a choice—they trade their suffering for emptiness. It's voluntary. That's what makes it so effective. People accept willingly because they're desperate, and the Hollow offers exactly what they need most: an end to pain."

"That's common knowledge," the guard said dismissively. "Try again."

"The common knowledge is wrong," Cassian countered. "People think the Hollow is offering freedom, but that's not what's happening. They're offering a transaction. A bargain. And like any bargain, there are terms. Rules. Mechanisms that govern how the exchange works." He leaned forward slightly. "The Hollow isn't some unknowable force. It's a system. And systems can be understood. Can be countered."

The guard's expression shifted from skepticism to interest. "You're saying there's a way to fight them?"

"I'm saying there's a way to understand them. Which is the first step to fighting them." Cassian met his gaze. "The King asked for advisors who could help him understand his enemy. I can do that."

The guard studied him for a long moment, then glanced at his companion—a younger guard who'd been listening with interest.

"What do you think, Ryan?" the older guard asked.

"I think he sounds more convincing than the fortune-teller we had this morning," Ryan said. "Or the priest who wanted to pray the Hollow away."

The older guard snorted. "Low bar to clear." He looked back at Cassian. "All right. But if you're wasting our time, the chamberlain will have you thrown out. And trust me, you don't want to cross Lord Herrick."

"Understood."

"Wait here."

The guards conferred briefly, and the younger one—Ryan—went inside. Cassian stood in the courtyard, watching the flow of petitioners. Most looked desperate. A few looked opportunistic, the kind who saw a kingdom in crisis as a chance for profit. None looked like they had real answers.

After what felt like an eternity but was probably only ten minutes, Ryan returned with a palace official in tow—a thin man in expensive clothes who moved with the precise efficiency of someone who valued every second. He looked Cassian up and down with obvious distaste, taking in the travel-worn clothes, the mud-stained boots, the lack of any visible wealth or status.

"Lord Herrick," the older guard said respectfully. "The King's chamberlain."

Herrick didn't acknowledge the introduction. "You're the ledger-keeper?"

"I am."

"From Millhaven. A village that barely exists on any map." Herrick's voice was cold, clipped. "What makes a village accountant think he can advise the King?"

"I don't claim to advise on matters of state," Cassian said evenly. "But I understand how the Hollow operates. How their bargains work. The mechanisms behind what they're doing to your kingdom."

"Do you." It wasn't a question. Herrick pulled a small notebook from his coat and consulted it. "We've had eleven people claiming knowledge of the Hollow this week. One was a priest who insisted prayer would solve everything. Three were merchants trying to sell us weapons that supposedly work against hollow converts. Two were charlatans offering protective charms. The rest were simply fools." He snapped the notebook shut. "Which are you?"

"The twelfth person. The one who's actually telling the truth."

Herrick's eyebrow rose fractionally. "Confidence. Or desperation?"

"Necessity," Cassian said. "My town was threatened by the Hollow. I couldn't afford to be wrong about how they work. So I learned. I studied. I bargained to gain knowledge that most people don't have access to."

"Bargained?" Herrick's eyes sharpened. "With whom?"

"Those who understand the old ways. The principles that govern the old bargains." Cassian held his gaze. "I paid a price for what I know. A heavy price. That's how I know it's genuine."

Herrick studied him for a long moment. Then he turned to the guards. "Is he cleared to enter?"

"Yes, my lord. The summons is genuine, signed by the guild."

"Very well." Herrick looked back at Cassian. "The council meets this afternoon at the fourth bell. You'll present your knowledge then. If your information proves worthless, you'll regret wasting our time. The King has no patience for fools, and neither do I."

"Understood."

"Follow me."

The gates swung open.

As Cassian stepped through, the coin suddenly flared hot against his chest—not burning, but pulsing with recognition. Another fragment. Close. Very close.

*In the palace,* Cassian realized. *Another fragment is in the palace.*

Which meant either the King had one and didn't know it, or someone at court was playing a far deeper game than anyone suspected.

He thought of Mira, somewhere in the city, searching for a brother who might be beyond saving. He thought of the refugee family on the road. He thought of the dream—Draven and himself, two sides of the same coin.

Then he stepped through the gates and into a world where every word, every gesture, every trade could mean the difference between salvation and damnation.

The palace swallowed him whole.

And in the city below, the Hollow preachers continued their work, offering peace to those in pain, one deal at a time.
