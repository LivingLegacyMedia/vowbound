# Chapter 3: The Tyrant's Advance

The first refugees arrived on a grey morning when the autumn mist still clung to the cobblestones.

Cassian was opening the counting house when he saw them—a ragged column of perhaps thirty people trudging through the market square. They moved with the defeated shuffle of those who'd walked too far on too little food. Children clung to their mothers' skirts. Old men leaned on makeshift canes. A woman carried a baby that didn't cry, which somehow seemed worse than if it had.

The townspeople stopped to stare. Refugees weren't uncommon—the kingdom had been at war for years, and displaced families often sought shelter in smaller towns. But something about these people was different. The way they flinched at sudden noises. The way their eyes darted constantly, as if expecting attack from any direction. The way they looked at the town with desperate hope mixed with bone-deep fear.

Cassian set down his ledger and walked toward the square. As he drew closer, the coin's perception activated. And what he saw troubled him.

Their shimmer was... *damaged*. Wounded. Like looking at a cracked mirror that still held its reflection, but distorted. They were still human, still themselves, but something had hurt them deeply. Left scars that went beyond the physical.

"Water," croaked an old man at the front of the column. "Please. The children—"

The magistrate's guards were already there, blocking the well. "No refugees without documentation," one said, hand on his sword hilt. "Orders from the magistrate. Too many mouths to feed already."

"We have money," the old man said desperately, fumbling at his belt. "We can pay—"

But when he opened his purse, only a few copper coins fell into his palm. Far too few for thirty people needing water, food, shelter.

Cassian stepped forward. "I'll pay for the water."

The guard turned, surprised. "Master Cassian?"

"They're thirsty. I'll cover the town's hospitality tax." He produced a silver coin—nearly a week's wages. "This should suffice for water and bread. At least for today."

The guard looked uncertain, but he took the coin. Town law was clear: pay the hospitality tax, gain entry. He couldn't refuse.

As the refugees were allowed to approach the well, the old man turned to Cassian. His eyes were gray and weary, but fierce. Still human. Still fighting.

"Thank you," the old man said quietly. Then, lower, almost a whisper: "But be careful, young man. They target the kind ones first. The generous ones. Those are the people they want most."

Cassian frowned. "Why?"

"Because kindness signals that you have something worth taking. And they're very good at making you trade it away." The old man glanced at the children drinking eagerly from the well. "We escaped before they could finish what they started. But others..." He shook his head. "Just be careful. That's all I'm saying."

He moved toward the well to help organize the water distribution, leaving Cassian standing alone with an uneasy feeling in his chest.

---

By evening, the town council had called an emergency meeting.

The magistrate's hall was packed. Cassian stood near the back, watching the chaos unfold. Townspeople were shouting over each other, demanding answers, expressing fears. The refugees had been quartered in the old grain warehouse, but their presence had sparked panic.

"They're running from the Hollow!" someone shouted. "That means the Hollow is coming here!"

"We should send them away," another voice called. "Before they bring doom on us all!"

"They're just families with children," widow Marta protested. "Children, for mercy's sake. Would you turn them out to die?"

"Better them than us!"

Magistrate Torven raised his hands for silence. The gesture took several attempts before the crowd quieted enough for him to speak.

"The refugees will be allowed to stay for three days," Torven announced. "After that, they must move on. We cannot support them indefinitely. These are the terms."

"But where will they go?" Marta asked. "The Hollow are everywhere—"

"That's not our concern," Torven interrupted. "We have our own people to protect. Three days. Final decision."

As the crowd began to disperse, still muttering, Cassian noticed someone watching him from across the hall. A woman, perhaps forty years old, with steel-grey hair and sharp, evaluating eyes. She wore traveler's clothes, but they were well-made. Expensive. Not a refugee.

Their gazes met, and she smiled slightly. Then she turned and slipped out of the hall.

---

Cassian found the refugees' spokesperson—the old man from that morning—in the warehouse after the meeting. The man was sitting on a crate, staring at nothing in particular.

"May I speak with you?" Cassian asked.

The old man looked up slowly. "The kind one. Yes. Sit, if you wish. Though I don't know what good it will do."

Cassian sat on an adjacent crate. Around them, families huddled in small groups, speaking in low voices. The atmosphere was oppressive—not just poverty and fear, but something deeper. Something wrong.

"What happened to your town?" Cassian asked quietly.

"We welcomed them," the old man said. His voice was flat, emotionless. "That was our mistake. The Hollow sent an emissary. A diplomat. He offered us peace. Protection. All we had to do was accept his terms."

"What terms?"

"They were... generous. Almost too generous. They would forgive our tax debts to the crown. Provide food for the hungry. Medicine for the sick. All they asked in return was that we acknowledge their authority. Sign a document. A formal agreement. It seemed harmless."

The old man's hands trembled slightly. "Our mayor signed it. The council signed it. We thought we were being clever. Practical. Why fight when we could negotiate?"

"What happened then?"

"Nothing. At first." The old man's voice dropped to barely a whisper. "They set up a trade post in the town square. Started offering... services. If you were suffering, they could take the suffering away. If you were grieving, they could erase the grief. If you owed debts, they could clear them. All through fair exchange, they said. Value for value. The Law of Balance made manifest."

Cassian felt cold. The Law of Balance. That sounded familiar.

"People accepted?" he asked.

"Oh, yes. Eagerly, at first. My neighbor's daughter had watched her son die of fever. The grief was destroying her. The Hollow offered to take it away—all her memories of him, all her pain. In exchange, she would serve them for a year. Just one year. She said yes." The old man's face was expressionless, but tears ran down his cheeks. "When she came back from their tent, she was smiling. Calm. Empty. She couldn't remember her son's name. Couldn't remember why she'd ever cared that he died."

"And others followed," Cassian said, starting to understand.

"Dozens. Then hundreds. The suffering ones went first. Then those with debts they couldn't pay. Then the ambitious ones, trading their uncertainty for confidence, their doubt for certainty. Each trade seemed fair. Each trade seemed voluntary. And each one left someone a little less human."

The old man looked directly at Cassian. "Within three months, half the town had traded something essential away. The Hollow didn't need to fight us—we were divided against ourselves. Those who'd become hollow convinced their families to join them. Neighbors turned on neighbors. Some of us tried to resist, tried to hold out, but..." He gestured helplessly. "When the Hollow's army finally marched in, there was no one left to fight them. The hollow ones welcomed them. The rest of us fled."

"An army?" Cassian asked.

"Oh yes. Soldiers marched on us. But they didn't raise a sword or a dagger." The old man's voice was bitter. "Why fight when you can just wait? When you can offer people exactly what they think they want, and let them give up everything that makes them who they are? By the time the army arrives, the city is already theirs."

Cassian sat in silence, processing this. The coin in his pocket felt heavier than usual.

"Who leads them?" he finally asked.

"Their master calls himself the Supreme Voice. Draven Kane." The old man spoke the name like a curse. "They say he's beautiful. Articulate. That when he speaks, you want to agree with him. That he can make emptiness sound like enlightenment."

"Have you seen him?"

"No. But I knew someone who met him. A merchant from our town, named Corvas. The Hollow invited him to negotiate under a flag of truce. When Corvas came back, he was... changed. He kept saying, 'Draven makes sense. It all makes sense. Why should we suffer when we can trade suffering away? Why should we cling to love when love only brings pain?' Within a week, Corvas had convinced his whole family to accept the Hollow's offer. All six of them became hollow together." 

The old man leaned closer. "That's what you need to understand, young man. Draven Kane doesn't just conquer through violence. He divides cities from within. Turns neighbor against neighbor. And then, when half the people have already sided with him, his army just walks in. No battle needed."

Cassian felt cold. "How do you fight that?"

"I don't know," the old man said wearily. "That's why we're here. Running. Hoping the next town can do what we couldn't."

A woman's voice spoke from behind them. "He's right."

Cassian turned to find the grey-haired woman from the town hall standing a few paces away. She looked at the old man with sympathy.

"You've shared enough, Marcus. Rest now."

The old man nodded wearily and shuffled away toward his family.

The woman turned to Cassian, studying him with an intensity that made him uncomfortable. "You're Rowan's son."

It wasn't a question.

"You knew my father?" Cassian asked warily.

"Walk with me," she said. "We should talk somewhere more private."

---

They walked through the dark streets of Millhaven, the woman keeping to the shadows. She moved with practiced ease, someone used to not being noticed.

"My name is Seris," she said finally. "I knew your father. We were part of the same guild—scholars who studied ancient artifacts and the legends surrounding them."

"What kind of artifacts?"

"The dangerous kind." She pulled something from her cloak—a small leather journal, worn and water-stained. "This belonged to Rowan. He left it with me years ago, before his last expedition. Said if anything happened to him, I should give it to you. But only if..." She paused, studying him. "Only if you'd inherited his gift."

"What gift?"

"The one in your left pocket." Her voice was sharp. "I've been watching you since I arrived this morning. The way you study people. The way you pause before speaking, as if pondering. The way you paid for the refugees without hesitation—not out of simple kindness, but because you *saw* something. The same way your father used to see things."

Cassian's hand moved instinctively toward his pocket, where the coin rested.

Seris smiled slightly. "Yes. The artifact your father spent his life searching for. He found it, didn't he? And now you have it."

She handed him the journal.

Cassian held it carefully. His father's handwriting was visible on the cover: *Notes and Observations*.

"The guild wanted this destroyed when Rowan died," Seris said. "They believe artifacts like his are too dangerous. That they should be locked away where no one can use them. But I..." She hesitated. "I think your father was right. That such things can be used for good. To help people."

"Why are you giving this to me?"

"Because you need to understand what you're facing. And because..." She stopped walking, turning to face him fully. "Some members want to destroy every artifact they find. Others want to study and control them. And some..." Her expression darkened. "Some have been compromised. They serve Draven's interests now, whether they know it or not."

"Draven Kane has something like what I have," Cassian said slowly. It made horrible sense.

"Yes. Similar, but different. Stronger in some ways. He stole it from the guild's vault fifteen years ago—we didn't realize until too late what he planned to do with it."

"How does he change people?"

Seris's jaw tightened. "We don't know exactly. But we believe he's found a way to corrupt his artifact's function. To transfer the cost of his trades onto others. When he makes an exchange, he doesn't pay the price—they do. And each trade takes a piece of them. Their suffering. Their love. Their memories. Until nothing human remains."

"That shouldn't be possible," Cassian said, thinking of the coin's fundamental nature.

"It shouldn't be," Seris agreed. "But he does it somehow. Your father was trying to understand how when he died. He suspected Draven had made some kind of fundamental bargain. Something that broke the normal rules."

She glanced over her shoulder, suddenly wary. "I can't stay. There are others watching. Guild members who would kill you if they found out what you have. Some will try to recruit you. Some will try to stop you." She paused. "And a few work for Draven now."

"Why should I trust you?"

A sad smile crossed her face. "You shouldn't. Trust no one completely. But your father believed these artifacts could save people instead of destroying them. I'd like to see if he was right." She started to walk away, then stopped. "Three days. That's how long the magistrate gave the refugees. But the Hollow knows they're here now. They'll send someone. Be ready."

She disappeared into the darkness before Cassian could ask anything more.

He stood alone in the street, holding his father's journal.

After a long moment, he opened it.

The first page read:

*The artifact is not evil. But it can be used for evil. The difference lies not in the power, but in what one chooses to trade. Draven trades humanity. We must trade something else. But what?*

*The answer may lie in what we're willing to sacrifice—and what we refuse to trade. Some things are not worth trading, no matter how high the reward.*

---

Cassian read late into the night by lamplight in his room.

His father's journal was dense with observations, theories, fragments of research. Notes on the artifact Rowan had sought his whole life. Speculation about its nature and limitations. Warnings about its dangers.

And scattered throughout, a recurring question:

*How do I stop someone who's learned to trade without paying the price?*

Rowan had never found the answer.

Now it fell to Cassian to try.

He was still reading when dawn began to grey the windows. His eyes burned with fatigue, but his mind was racing with what he'd learned.

Draven Kane had an artifact like his. But Draven had corrupted it somehow. Found a way to make others pay the costs of his trades. Built an empire on stolen humanity.

And now the Hollow was spreading. Town by town. Trade by trade. Offering people exactly what they thought they wanted, then hollowing them out from within. And when enough people in a city had been turned, Draven's army simply marched in. No siege needed. No battle. The city divided against itself could not stand.

*It's brilliant,* Cassian realized with horror. *And it works because they choose it for themselves. They agree to the terms. How do you fight an army that people surrender to wilingly?*

A commotion outside interrupted his thoughts.

He went to the window and looked down at the market square. A crowd was gathering. And in the center stood a figure in grey and white.

The Hollow had sent their emissary.

---

By the time Cassian reached the square, half the town had assembled. The figure stood calmly in the center, making no threatening moves. He was young, handsome in a sculptured way, with a pleasant smile and empty eyes.

"I am Valen," he announced, his voice carrying easily. "Emissary of the Hollow. I come under flag of truce to deliver a message to the people of Millhaven."

Magistrate Torven pushed through the crowd, guards at his flanks. "We want nothing from you. Leave our town."

"Of course, Magistrate. As soon as I've delivered my message." Valen's smile remained pleasant. "The Hollow wishes to extend an offer of peace. We understand you harbor refugees from the east. We bear them no ill will. In fact, we'd welcome them back."

He let that sink in, then continued. "All we ask is that Millhaven sign a simple trade agreement. Acknowledge our authority in the eastern provinces. In exchange, we guarantee your safety. Your autonomy. Your prosperity."

"We bow to no tyrant," someone shouted from the crowd.

Valen looked genuinely puzzled. "Tyrant? We offer freedom. Freedom from suffering. Freedom from want. All through fair exchange." His gaze swept the crowd. "How many of you struggle with debt? With hunger? With grief? The Hollow can help. All we ask is that you trade freely. Value for value. Your pain for peace."

Cassian watched from the edge of the crowd, studying the emissary with his sixth sense.

The shimmer around Valen was strong, but different. Not empty like the refugees, but twisted. Distorted. Like looking at a reflection in warped glass. The man was human, but something fundamental had been altered.

"May we have three days to consider?" Magistrate Torven asked, his voice tight.

"Three days would be generous," Valen agreed pleasantly. "We'll send a representative to receive your answer then." He bowed slightly. "Choose wisely. We don't make this offer twice."

He turned and walked away, moving through the crowd. People stepped back from him instinctively, creating a clear path.

When he was gone, the square erupted in chaos. Some wanted to fight. Others wanted to accept. Many just wanted to flee.

Cassian stood silent, watching it all.

In his pocket, the coin felt warm against his palm. And in his mind, his father's words echoed:

*How do I stop someone who's learned to trade without paying the price?*

Three days.

That's all the time he had to figure out how to fight an enemy who made evil look like mercy. Who corrupted the same power Cassian wielded. Who offered people exactly what they thought they wanted and hollowed out their soul.

The war had come to Millhaven.

And Cassian still didn't know how to fight it.
