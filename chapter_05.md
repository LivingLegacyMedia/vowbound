# Chapter 5: The Bargain Beneath the Earth

Inside the old chapel, moonlight filtered through holes in the ceiling, illuminating dust and debris. Seris moved to the altar, knelt, and pressed something. A grinding sound echoed through the chapel as a section of floor swung inward, revealing stone steps descending into absolute darkness.

"The catacombs," Cassian breathed. Every town had them—burial tunnels from centuries past. Most were sealed, deemed unsafe. Some said they connected to older structures beneath, remnants of civilizations that predated the kingdom itself.

Seris was already descending. Cassian followed.

---

The stairs went down far longer than seemed possible. Cassian counted a hundred steps, then two hundred, then lost track. The air grew cold and damp, carrying a mineral smell that reminded him of ancient stone and forgotten things.

Finally, the stairs ended in a tunnel. Seris produced a small lantern, its flame casting dancing shadows on walls carved with symbols Cassian didn't recognize. Some looked like the markings on the coin itself.

They walked in silence for what felt like hours. The tunnel branched occasionally, but Seris never hesitated. Cassian tried to memorize the path, but after the fifth or sixth turn, he gave up. If she abandoned him here, he'd never find his way back.

At last, they emerged into a vast underground chamber.

It was a marketplace.

Or had been, once. Stone stalls lined the walls, their surfaces worn smooth by countless transactions. In the center stood a circular platform, its surface engraved with concentric rings of text in that same alien script. Above, the ceiling was lost in shadow, though Cassian could hear water dripping somewhere far overhead.

But it was the *feeling* of the place that made him stop. Using the coin's perception, he saw value shimmer everywhere—thick in the air like fog, pooling in corners, flowing between the ancient stalls like invisible rivers. This wasn't just a place where trades had happened. The impressions were so thick, so ancient, that they'd saturated the very stone.

Cassian pulled out his father's journal, flipping to the entry he'd puzzled over. *The Old Market. Beneath.* This had to be it.

"Older than old," Seris said quietly. "This place was trading in souls before your kingdom existed. Before the Hollow. Before the fragments scattered." She gestured to the platform. "Stand there. He's already waiting."

"Who?"

Seris merely pointed toward the platform, and then retreated back into one of the tunnels, leaving Cassian alone.

Cassian walked to the platform, each step echoing through the chamber. As he stepped onto the engraved surface, the air seemed to thicken, pressing against him from all sides.

And then the shadows moved.

---

It didn't form so much as *gather*—darkness pulling itself together from corners and crevices, coalescing into something vaguely human-shaped. Tall. Thin. With too many joints in its limbs and eyes that were holes in reality rather than organs.

When it spoke, the voice came from everywhere and nowhere, layered with harmonics that shouldn't exist in human speech.

**"So another finds his way here."**

Cassian's mouth was dry. "Who are you?"

**"Who? What an inadequate question."** The shadow-thing tilted its head. **"I am a servant of the Equitors. Or I was, before they fell. Now I serve what they left behind—the Law itself. The balance that must be kept."** A pause. **"I am the Dealer."**

"You knew my father."

Something like amusement flickered in those void-eyes. **"Yes, Rowan. Twenty-three years ago your father found me. He was a desperate soul. Wanting to understand what he'd found."**

"What did you tell him?"

**"The same thing I tell all who seek me out."** The Dealer circled him slowly. **"First, the price must be paid. Then the knowledge will come."**

Cassian forced himself to stand straight. "I need to know about the Hollow. How they're taking cities. How to stop them."

**"Need. Want."** The Dealer's form rippled. **"Always the same words. Always the same desires."**

"Will you tell me what I want to know?"

**"Perhaps."** The creature moved in strange, stuttering motions, as if skipping between moments. **"If the price is sufficient for the reward."**

"What price?"

**"That depends on what you're truly asking."** The Dealer stopped. **"Surface questions have surface costs. But deeper truths... those require more payment."**

Cassian clenched his jaw. "Then tell me what it costs to understand my enemy."

**"Your enemy."** The Dealer seemed to consider this. **"The one who leads the Hollow. The one who bears what you bear."**

"Draven Kane."

**"To understand him, you must understand what he has done. What he has taken. What he has refused to pay."**

"Then tell me. Tell me what I must pay to get this information."

**"A memory. One you cherish. One that defines you."** The Dealer extended something like a hand. **"Give me the memory of your mother's face, and I will tell you about the enemy."**

The request hit Cassian like a physical blow. His mother had died when he was seven—a fever, sudden and cruel. He barely remembered her. But her face... that was all he had left. The warmth of her smile. The color of her eyes. The way she looked when she tucked him in at night.

"No." The word came out strangled. "Something else. Anything else."

**"There is nothing else you value so highly that would balance the knowledge you seek."** The Dealer's voice was patient, almost kind. **"That is the nature of fair exchange. You want to understand your greatest enemy? Then you must pay with your greatest treasure."**

"I have gold. I can pay you in—"

**"Metal?"** The Dealer's laughter was like wind through a crypt. **"Your currencies mean nothing to me, child. I deal in items of deeper value. Things that shape you. Things that make you human."**

Cassian's hands were shaking. "What about... what about a skill? I can trade a skill. My ability to—"

**"Your ability to count? To assess value?"** The Dealer circled him. **"Interesting. That would cripple you, render the fragment nearly useless in your hands. But it would not balance the scales. The information I offer is worth more than a talent. It requires something irreplaceable."**

"Then tell me something smaller. Just—just tell me how to protect my town. That's all I need to know."

**"To protect your town, you must understand the enemy. To understand the enemy, you must know what he has done, how he thinks, what drives him. There are no small answers to large questions."** The Dealer stopped directly in front of him. **"This is your choice: Pay the price and gain the knowledge that might save thousands. Or keep your memory and watch them all fall."**

Cassian tried to think, but panic clouded his mind. His mother's face. The only thing he had left of her. If he gave that up, she'd be truly gone. No photographs in a poor counting house. No one left alive who remembered her well enough to describe her. Just... nothing.

"How do I know the information will be worth it?" he asked desperately.

**"You don't."** The Dealer tilted its head. **"That, too, is the nature of the bargain. Faith and risk. You gamble what you love against what you need."** A pause. **"Your father understood this. He paid without hesitation."**

"My father was desperate."

**"And you are not?"** The void-eyes fixed on him. **"Then leave. Go back to your little town. Wait for the Hollow to arrive. Watch them offer escape to everyone you've tried to help. Watch them sign the contracts. Watch them empty."**

The Dealer began to fade.

"Wait!"

Cassian closed his eyes. His mother's face rose in his mind—the last clear image he had. Brown eyes, warm and gentle. Dark hair that curled at the ends. A small scar on her chin from when she'd fallen as a girl. The way her whole face transformed when she smiled, like sunlight breaking through clouds.

He tried to memorize it. Tried to burn every detail into his mind so thoroughly that even magic couldn't take it away.

But he knew it wouldn't work. The Dealer didn't deal in half-measures.

He thought of the refugees stumbling into town. The hollow-eyed woman with the baby. The man who'd forgotten his own name. All the people his father had tried to save and failed. All the people Cassian was failing now by not knowing enough.

What was one memory compared to that?

His mother had died to a fever. Random. Meaningless. But maybe... maybe her face could buy something she'd never had the chance to give: a way to protect people. To save them.

She would have wanted that. He thought she would have. He wished he could remember her well enough to be sure.

"I accept," Cassian whispered. "Take it. Tell me how to stop them."

---

The Dealer moved with sudden, terrible speed. Its hand—if it was a hand—touched Cassian's forehead, and the world inverted.

He was seven years old again, small and scared, watching his mother tuck blankets around him. She was humming something—what was it? A lullaby. Her face was so clear, so close. Brown eyes that caught the candlelight. That scar on her chin. The silver chain she always wore around her neck.

"Sweet dreams, little rabbit," she said, and kissed his forehead.

Then the memory started to *unravel*.

Her face blurred at the edges first, like ink in water. He tried to hold onto it, to memorize the curve of her cheek, the exact shade of her eyes, but it slipped through his mental grasp like smoke. The details fled—first the scar, then the necklace, then the color of her eyes, then the shape of her smile.

"No—wait—please—"

But the Dealer didn't stop. The extraction continued, ruthless and thorough. Every memory of her face, ripped away. Tucking him in at night—her face blurred to nothing. Laughing at something his father said—face gone. Crying when she thought he couldn't see—face vanished. Smiling at him across the breakfast table—erased.

He saw the memories play out like a theater performance where the lead actress had been replaced by a blank-faced mannequin. A woman-shaped absence. All the love was still there, all the warmth and care, but the person behind it had become anonymous. Generic. Lost.

A scream built in his throat but never emerged. His body wouldn't obey. He was frozen, forced to witness the systematic deletion of his mother's defining feature from his entire history.

And then it was over.

Cassian collapsed to his knees, gasping. He pressed his palms against his eyes, trying desperately to remember. *Brown eyes. Or were they green? Dark hair. Or was it light?* Nothing. Just empty space. A void where love used to have a face.

The loss was so profound, so complete, that for a moment he couldn't breathe. It felt like dying. Like having a piece of his soul carved out with a dull knife.

**"Good,"** the Dealer said, and its voice was almost gentle. **"You feel the pain because the trade was fair. The greater the loss, the greater the gain. Now. You wanted answers? I'll give them."**

Cassian could barely speak. His throat was raw, though he didn't remember screaming. "The Hollow," he managed. "Tell me. Tell me how they actually do it. I know they offer to take people's pain, their debts, their poverty. I know people choose emptiness over trouble. But how does Draven make it work?"

**"Ah. The means. Yes."** The Dealer's form shifted, becoming almost solid for a moment. **"But understand: what you learn will expose you to greater danger. And knowing how the trap works doesn't make you immune to it."**

"I'll take that risk."

**"They always do."** The Dealer circled him slowly. **"The Hollow doesn't just offer escape. They offer a formal exchange. A contract. Once signed, the terms are binding."**

Cassian nodded. "I've seen it. Documents that spell out exactly what they're trading."

**"When they sign, they accept more than just peace. They accept Draven's debts. All the costs he refuses to pay—transferred into their emptied shells. They become living vessels for his corruption. He can make a thousand trades and pay nothing, because he has a thousand hollow vessels to bear the weight."**

"Seris told me he has a fragment. Like mine. But she didn't know how he corrupted it."

**"Corrupted?"** The Dealer made a sound like grinding stone. **"No. Not corrupted. The fragment remains intact. But it no longer functions as intended. The Law still requires balance, but the coin does not collect."** The Dealer leaned close. **"He found a loophole."**

"What did he do exactly?" Cassian demanded.

**The fragment is imprisoned. Caged."** The void-eyes fixed on Cassian. **"He built a prison of gold around it. Hid the coin's dark face. The face that collects payment."**

"That's..." Cassian tried to comprehend it. "That's why he doesn't pay."

**"The Law requires balance,"** the Dealer said. **"It requires that debts be paid. But it does not specify who must pay them. As long as someone pays, balance is maintained."**

Horror crept up Cassian's spine. "The contracts. How are they bound to the fragment? Can they be broken? Could I—"

**"Those answers cost more than you have."** The Dealer was barely visible now. **"But I will tell you this: he's been perfecting for years what you have only known about for a few days. If you face him as you are, you will lose."**

"Then how do I stop him?"

**"Stop him?"** The Dealer's voice carried something that might have been amusement. **"You cannot. Not with what little you know."**

"There has to be—"

**"He is coming for you,"** the Dealer interrupted. **"He hunts those who carry the fragments. He will sense you. Find you. And when he does, he will offer you a choice."** The voice was fading now. **"Everyone chooses."**

"Wait!" Cassian struggled to his feet. "Give me something. Anything I can use against him."

A long silence. Then, so faint Cassian almost missed it:

**"The fragments know each other. Find the others before he does, and it might be enough."**

And then the Dealer was gone, leaving Cassian alone in the ancient marketplace with a gaping hole where his mother's face used to be.

---

The journey back was agony.

Not physical pain—though his head throbbed and his legs shook with exhaustion. It was the *absence* that hurt. Every few steps, his mind would reach for his mother's face, some part of him not yet understanding that it was gone. Each time, he'd find only blankness, and the loss would hit him again, fresh and terrible.

He climbed the stairs in darkness, feeling his way along the walls. Seris had left the lantern, or maybe she hadn't—he couldn't remember. Time felt strange, disconnected. He counted steps to keep himself grounded. Two hundred. Three hundred. His legs burned. Good. Pain was something real to hold onto.

In the tunnel, he stumbled and caught himself against the carved wall. His hand pressed against one of those ancient symbols—markings like the ones on the coin. Under his fingers, he felt something like warmth, like value stored in the stone itself.

*This place was trading in souls before your kingdom existed.*

How many other people had walked these tunnels? How many had stood before the Dealer and traded away pieces of themselves? How many had climbed these stairs afterward, hollow and haunted?

His father had. Twenty-three years ago, Rowan had walked this same path. What did he trade? Had he felt like this? Like something essential had been carved out, leaving only raw edges behind?

By the time Cassian emerged into the chapel, dawn was breaking. Grey light filtered through the holes in the ceiling, illuminating dust motes that danced like tiny ghosts. He stood there, swaying, watching the light strengthen.

He tried one more time to remember his mother's face.

Nothing.

Just a shape. A silhouette. A woman who'd loved him, whose name he knew, whose voice he could almost hear—but whose face had been completely erased from his memory, as if she'd never existed at all.

Cassian walked through the waking town in a daze. People were opening shops, calling greetings to neighbors, living their lives. None of them knew what was coming. None of them understood that the Hollow wasn't just an army—it was a choice. A bargain. An escape that would cost them everything.

And now he knew how it worked. What Draven had done. The loophole in the Law itself.

Was it worth it? Worth losing his mother's face?

He didn't know. Wouldn't know until he tried to use the information. Until he faced Draven and tried to stop him.

That was the cruelty of the Dealer's bargain: you paid first, and only later discovered if you'd bought anything of value.

---

When he finally stumbled into the counting house, Seris was waiting.

She took one look at him and her expression shifted—not quite sympathy, but recognition. Understanding. She'd seen this before.

"You paid," she said quietly.

Cassian nodded, unable to speak. He tried to picture his mother and found only a dark silhouette, a blur where her face should be. The absence felt like a physical wound.

"Sit," Seris commanded gently. She guided him to a chair, pressed a cup of water into his hands. He drank without tasting it.

"I'm sorry," she said after a long moment. "I know the cost is high. Your father paid a heavy cost when he came here. A memory of his wedding day. He said it was the only way to understand what he was really fighting."

Cassian's hands trembled around the cup. "Did he... did he regret it?"

Seris was quiet for a long moment. "Every day," she finally said. "And never, at the same time. He told me once that the trade haunted him—that he'd catch himself trying to remember, reaching for something that wasn't there anymore. But he also said that if he hadn't paid the price, he wouldn't have known how to protect you. How to hide the fragment. How to keep you safe as long as he did."

"I can't remember her face." The words came out broken. "My mother. I can remember everything else—her voice, her hands, the way she smelled like bread and lavender. But her face is just... gone."

"I know." Seris knelt beside his chair. "It doesn't get easier. The hole doesn't fill. But you learn to live with it. Your father did. And you will too."

Cassian's knees gave out then, even though he was already sitting. His whole body slumped, exhaustion and grief overwhelming him. He sat heavily on the floor, head in his hands, and finally let himself feel the full weight of what he'd lost.

Seris stayed beside him, quiet, giving him space to grieve.

After what might have been minutes or hours, she finally spoke. "What did he tell you?" Her voice was careful, gentle. "Was it worth what you bargained for?"

Cassian had to think about that. He sorted through what he'd learned, forcing his mind to organize the information despite the fog of grief.

"The contracts," he said slowly. "They're not just agreements. When people sign them, they're accepting Draven's debts without knowing it. All the costs he refuses to pay get transferred into their emptied shells."

Seris looked thoughtful. "We suspected something along those lines. The contracts are very detailed. We don't know how they're connected to Draven, but we assumed he must use them somehow to cheat in his personal bargains."

"It's the fragment," Cassian continued, his voice growing stronger as he focused on the problem instead of the loss. "He's caged it. Built a prison of gold around it, hiding the dark face...the face that collects payment. The Law still requires balance, requires that debts be paid. But it doesn't specify *who* must pay them."

Seris sat back on her heels. "So he can make any trade he wants, take anything he wants, and the price is... just paid by someone else."

"By the Hollow. By everyone who signs his contracts." Cassian looked up at her. "He's been perfecting this for years. He has thousands of vessels. Maybe tens of thousands by now. Every person who becomes Hollow is another repository for his corruption. Another way to cheat the Law."

"And the fragment just... allows this?"

"The Dealer said the fragment isn't corrupted. It still works as intended—it still enforces the Law of balance. But Draven found a loophole. As long as *someone* pays, balance is maintained. The coin doesn't care who suffers, only that the scales are even."

Seris stood, began pacing. "Then how do we stop him? If the fragment itself is trapped, if he's found a way around the Law—"

"I asked him that." Cassian pulled himself back into the chair, every movement feeling like he was dragging weights. "The Dealer said I can't stop him. Not as I am. Not with what little I know." He paused. "But he said something else. Right before he disappeared. He said the fragments know each other. That I should find the others before Draven does."

Seris stopped pacing. "Did he say how many fragments there are?"

"I don't know. My father's journal mentioned them being scattered, but never said how many." Cassian rubbed his face. "The Dealer called them keys to understanding everything. If Draven is hunting them..."

"Then he wants them all." Seris moved to a cabinet, pulled out a leather satchel. "Your father left records. Everything he learned about the fragments, the Equitors, the Old Market. I've kept them hidden since he died. He made me promise to give them to you only if you came back from the Dealer. Only if you paid the price."

She set the satchel on the table between them. It was heavy, bulging with papers and small objects.

"He said you'd need them. Said you'd have questions he couldn't answer while he was alive." Her voice was quiet. "I think he knew you'd follow his path. I think he wanted you to be ready."

Cassian stared at the satchel. His father's life's work, sitting there waiting for him. Research bought with a wedding day memory. Knowledge paid for with happiness.

And now Cassian had added his own payment to that legacy. His mother's face, traded for information about an enemy he wasn't sure he could beat.

"Why did my father hide the fragment from the Guild?" he asked.

"He didn't trust them." Seris's voice was careful. "That's all I'll say for now. When you've read his journals, I'll tell you more. But first, you need to recover from the price you paid. You need to write down what you were told while it's still fresh. And you need to rest."

Cassian wanted to argue, wanted to tear into the satchel immediately, but exhaustion was pulling at him like a lead weight. His head throbbed. His eyes burned. And every few seconds, his mind still reached for his mother's face and found only emptiness.

"Go upstairs," Seris said. "Sleep. I'll bring food later. You can read through it tomorrow."

She left before he could respond, taking the lantern with her. Cassian sat alone in the grey morning light, staring at the satchel.

Tomorrow. Tomorrow he'd learn what his father had discovered. Tomorrow he'd plan his next move.

But today, he just needed to survive the loss.

---

He did write it down first, though. Before he slept, before he let exhaustion take him, Cassian found paper and ink and recorded everything the Dealer had told him. The contracts. The caged fragment. The prison of gold. The loophole in the Law.

His hand shook as he wrote. Twice, he had to stop and breathe through waves of grief. But he forced himself to continue. This was what he'd paid for. This knowledge had cost his mother's face. He wouldn't let it slip away forgotten.

When he finished, he read it through once, making sure it was legible. Then he climbed the stairs to the small room above the counting house—his room now, apparently—and collapsed onto the narrow bed.

He tried not to think about his mother. Tried not to reach for the memory that wasn't there anymore. Tried not to feel the empty space in his mind where her face used to live.

He failed at all three.

But eventually, exhaustion won, and he slept dreamless and deep, with the coin heavy in his pocket and his father's satchel waiting downstairs.

---

The next two days passed in a blur of reading.

Cassian devoured his father's journals. There were twelve of them, spanning twenty-three years, filled with cramped handwriting that grew increasingly desperate as the years progressed. 

Seeing his father's hand for the first time in years made something twist in Cassian's chest. The familiar slant of the letters. The way his father always pressed too hard with the pen, leaving impressions on the pages beneath. It was like hearing his voice again—urgent, analytical, tinged with desperation.

His father had been systematic, methodical—tracking every rumor about the fragments, every piece of ancient lore, every story about the Equitors who'd once enforced the Law of balance across the world.

The fragments were pieces of something larger, his father wrote. Tools created by the Equitors to assess value, to weigh exchanges, to maintain fairness in all transactions. Seven fragments in total, scattered when the Equitors fell centuries ago. Each one granted its bearer the ability to see and understand value—but also the temptation to manipulate it.

*The fragments don't corrupt,* his father had written. *They reveal. They show us what we already are. A just person will use them justly. A greedy person will find ways to take without paying. The tool is neutral. The wielder is not.*

Draven Kane had been the first to find a fragment in over a hundred years—or at least, the first anyone knew about. He'd been an alchemist, his father's notes said. A failed one, bitter about his inability to transmute base metals into gold. But when he found the fragment, everything changed for him. He'd discovered the loophole about eight years ago. That's when the Hollow first appeared.

Cassian found maps too. Locations where other fragments might be hidden, based on his father's research. One in the capital city, somewhere in the old Guild headquarters. One in the northern mountains, in a monastery that predated the kingdom. One in the Sunken City on the western coast—though that one was marked with a question mark and the word *maybe*.

And there were notes about the Guild itself. His father's growing suspicion that they knew more than they admitted. That some of the senior members might be actively searching for fragments themselves. That they'd begun watching Rowan, asking questions, making threats.

*They want to control them all,* his father had written in one of the later journals. *They believe the fragments should be locked away, kept from the world. They don't understand that the fragments ARE the world—the fundamental truth of exchange that underlies everything we do. You can't lock away truth. You can only understand it or be destroyed by it.*

On the second afternoon, Seris brought him tea and sat while he read.

"He spent years on this," Cassian said, gesturing at the spread of journals and papers. "Years trying to understand what he'd found. And in the end, it killed him."

"The fever killed him," Seris corrected gently. "Not the research."

"But the stress didn't help." Cassian closed the journal he was holding. "All this knowledge, all this work, and he still couldn't figure out how to stop Draven. Still couldn't find a way to free the fragment from its cage."

"Maybe he wasn't meant to." Seris sipped her tea. "Maybe that's your task. You have what he learned, plus what the Dealer told you. You're starting further ahead than he ever got."

Cassian thought about that. Thought about his father paying with a wedding day memory, spending his life in poverty and obsession, dying without solving the puzzle. And now Cassian was walking the same path, already missing his mother's face, already obsessed with understanding the fragments.

Was this his fate? To follow his father's footsteps into failure?

"The capital," he said suddenly. "My father's map shows a fragment there. In the old Guild headquarters."

"Yes. He tried to get to it once, years ago. They turned him away. He wasn't senior enough to access the archives." Seris set down her tea. "But you... you have something he didn't. You have the King's attention. Or you will, if you answer his summons."

"What summons?"

Seris pulled a folded paper from her pocket. "This arrived yesterday. A messenger from the capital. The King is calling for advisors, scholars, anyone who understands trade or the Hollow's methods. He's offering substantial rewards for information."

Cassian took the paper, read it through. The King's seal at the bottom—official, urgent. A summons to present himself within the fortnight.

His stomach dropped as he read further. "This says the Hollow army was spotted three weeks north of the capital. They're moving south, toward the seat of power." He looked up at Seris. "Draven is leading them there."

"Yes. The capital is the prize. Take the King, take the kingdom." Seris's expression was grim. "That's why the King is desperate for information."

"If I go to the capital, Draven could sense me," Cassian said quietly. "The Dealer said the fragments know each other. If Draven is that close, and I bring my coin there..." He didn't finish the thought.

"He'll know there's another fragment-bearer nearby," Seris finished. "Yes. But if he's marching on the capital, there's a reason. Probably he is targeting the same fragment your father tried to reach. If Draven gets it before you do..."

She didn't need to finish. Two fragments in Draven's hands would make him even more unstoppable.

"Better to face him in the capital, surrounded by the King's guard and armies, than alone on a road somewhere," Seris continued. "Or worse—here, where everyone you're trying to protect could become collateral when he comes hunting."

She was right. He knew she was right. But the thought of deliberately putting himself in Draven's path—in a city already under siege—made his stomach clench with fear.

"There's another fragment there," Seris continued. "If you can find it before Draven does, you'll have two to his one. That might be enough of an advantage."

"Or it might make me a bigger target."

"Everything makes you a target now." Seris stood, gathering the tea cups. "You're carrying a fragment. You paid the Dealer's price. You know too much to hide and not enough to fight. The only path forward is to learn more, find the other fragments, and hope you can figure out what your father couldn't."

Cassian looked at the journals again. Years of work. A lifetime of sacrifice. And still no answer.

But his father had been alone. Working in secret. Hiding from the Guild.

Maybe Cassian didn't have to follow that exact path. Maybe he could find allies. Maybe, just maybe, he could do what his father couldn't.

"I'll go," he said. "I'll answer the summons. But I need to be ready first. I need to understand this better." He gestured at the journals. "Give me one more day. Then I'll pack."

Seris nodded. "One more day. Then you leave for the capital, and everything changes."

She left him alone with his father's life's work and the weight of impossible choices.

---

On the third morning, Cassian packed his few belongings into a travel sack. The journals went in first, wrapped in oiled cloth to protect them from rain. Then the maps, carefully folded. A change of clothes. Some bread and cheese Seris had prepared.

And the coin, always in his pocket. Always heavy. Always there.

He found his father's last journal entry, written just days before Rowan died. Read it one more time, letting the words sink in.

*To my son, if you are reading this: I'm sorry. Sorry for leaving you in poverty, sorry for leaving you this burden. But I believed—still believe—that these fragments aren't just tools of power. They're keys to everything worth preserving in this world.*

*Whatever happens: know that giving you this wasn't desperation. It was hope.*

*—R.*

Cassian closed the journal. Touched the coin one last time.

Then he walked downstairs.

Seris was waiting by the counting house door with a horse—a modest mare, brown and steady-looking. "She's old but reliable," Seris said. "Should get you to the capital in five days if you don't push her."

"I can't afford a horse."

"Consider it a loan. I'll add it to your father's debt." She smiled slightly. "You can pay me back when you've saved us all."

Cassian took the reins, led the horse outside into the morning sun. "What if I can't? What if I'm not strong enough, not smart enough? What if I get to the capital and Draven just... takes the fragment from me?"

"Then we were doomed anyway." Seris's voice was matter-of-fact. "But I don't think that's what will happen. I think you'll find the other fragments. I think you'll learn how to fight him. And I think, when the time comes, you'll make the choice your father couldn't make."

"What choice?"

"The one between hiding and acting. Between protecting yourself and protecting everyone else." She stepped back. "Your father chose to hide. To keep the fragment safe by keeping it secret. Maybe that was the right choice at the time. But it's not an option anymore. You have to act now, or watch everything fall."

Cassian mounted the horse, settling into the worn saddle. From this height, he could see over the town walls to the fields beyond. Peaceful. Quiet. Unaware of the storm coming from the north.

"Take care of them," he said. "While I'm gone. The refugees, the town. If the Hollow comes before I return—"

"I'll do what I can," Seris promised. "But you're our best hope. Remember that when things get hard. Remember what you're fighting for."

Cassian nodded. Then he urged the horse forward, through the gate, onto the road that led south to the capital.

To answers, hopefully.

To other fragments.

To a confrontation with an enemy who'd been perfecting the art of exploitation for years while Cassian had been counting coins in a poor town at the edge of nowhere.

Behind him, the town receded into the distance. Ahead, the road stretched empty and waiting.

And in his pocket, the coin grew warm, as if sensing something in the distance. Another fragment, perhaps. Or just the weight of destiny pressing down.

Cassian tried one more time to remember his mother's face. Found only the familiar emptiness. The blank space where love used to have features.

But he also found something else: determination.

He'd paid the price. Now it was time to make his sacrifice worth something.

The horse's hooves beat a steady rhythm on the packed earth. And Cassian rode south, toward a capital city full of kings and nobles and enemies who didn't yet know they were already caught in Draven Kane's web.

Including him.

But maybe—just maybe—he could find a way to cut those threads before they pulled tight.
