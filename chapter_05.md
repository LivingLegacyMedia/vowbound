# Chapter 5: The Bargain Beneath the Earth

Seris found Cassian three days after the conscription began.

He was in the counting house, trying to work through his father's ledgers—not the town's records, but Rowan's private journals. Pages and pages of sketches, half-formed theories, and notes in his father's cramped handwriting about "value essence" and "exchange fundamentals." Most of it was incomprehensible, written in a kind of shorthand that might as well have been another language.

But scattered throughout were place names. Locations. One appeared more than others: *The Old Market. Beneath. Where trades are made that sunlight cannot witness.*

Cassian had assumed it was metaphor. His father had been prone to dramatic phrasing.

The knock came just after midnight—three sharp raps, then silence.

When Cassian opened the door, Seris was already turning away. "Follow or don't," she said. "But if you want real answers about what you carry, this is your only chance."

Cassian grabbed his coat and followed.

---

They moved through the sleeping town like ghosts, keeping to shadows and alleyways. Seris never looked back, never slowed. Cassian had to jog to keep pace.

"Where are we going?" he called softly.

"Somewhere your father went," she said. "When he needed answers he couldn't find anywhere else."

They reached the old chapel at the town's edge—abandoned for a decade after the roof collapsed during a storm. Seris slipped through a gap in the boarded entrance. Cassian hesitated only a moment before following.

Inside, moonlight filtered through holes in the ceiling, illuminating dust and debris. Seris moved to the altar, knelt, and pressed something. A grinding sound echoed through the chapel as a section of floor swung inward, revealing stone steps descending into absolute darkness.

"The catacombs," Cassian breathed. Every town had them—burial tunnels from centuries past. Most were sealed, deemed unsafe. Some said they connected to older structures beneath, remnants of civilizations that predated the kingdom itself.

Seris was already descending. Cassian followed.

---

The stairs went down far longer than seemed possible. Cassian counted a hundred steps, then two hundred, then lost track. The air grew cold and damp, carrying a mineral smell that reminded him of ancient stone and forgotten things.

Finally, the stairs ended in a tunnel. Seris produced a small lantern, its flame casting dancing shadows on walls carved with symbols Cassian didn't recognize. Some looked like the markings on the coin itself.

They walked in silence for what felt like hours. The tunnel branched occasionally, but Seris never hesitated. Cassian tried to memorize the path, but after the fifth or sixth turn, he gave up. If she abandoned him here, he'd never find his way back.

At last, they emerged into a vast underground chamber.

It was a marketplace.

Or had been, once. Stone stalls lined the walls, their surfaces worn smooth by countless transactions. In the center stood a circular platform, its surface engraved with concentric rings of text in that same alien script. Above, the ceiling was lost in shadow, though Cassian could hear water dripping somewhere far overhead.

But it was the *feeling* of the place that made him stop. Using the coin's perception, he saw value shimmer everywhere—thick in the air like fog, pooling in corners, flowing between the ancient stalls like invisible rivers. This wasn't just a place where trades had happened. The impressions were so thick, so ancient, that they'd saturated the very stone.

Cassian pulled out his father's journal, flipping to the entry he'd puzzled over. *The Old Market. Beneath.* This had to be it.

"Older than old," Seris said quietly. "This place was trading in souls before your kingdom existed. Before the Hollow. Before the fragments scattered." She gestured to the platform. "Stand there. He's already waiting."

"Who?"

Seris merely pointed toward the platform, and then retreated back into one of the tunnels, leaving Cassian alone.

Cassian walked to the platform, each step echoing through the chamber. As he stepped onto the engraved surface, the air seemed to thicken, pressing against him from all sides.

And then the shadows moved.

---

It didn't form so much as *gather*—darkness pulling itself together from corners and crevices, coalescing into something vaguely human-shaped. Tall. Thin. With too many joints in its limbs and eyes that were holes in reality rather than organs.

When it spoke, the voice came from everywhere and nowhere, layered with harmonics that shouldn't exist in human speech.

**"So another finds his way here."**

Cassian's mouth was dry. "Who are you?"

**"Who? What an inadequate question."** The shadow-thing tilted its head. **"I am a servant of the Equitors. Or I was, before they fell. Now I serve what they left behind—the Law itself. The balance that must be kept."** A pause. **"I am the Dealer."**

"You knew my father."

Something like amusement flickered in those void-eyes. **"Yes, Rowan. Twenty-three years ago your father found me. He was a desperate soul. Wanting to understand what he'd found."**

"What did you tell him?"

**"The same thing I tell all who seek me out."** The Dealer circled him slowly. **"First, the price must be paid. Then the knowledge will come."**

Cassian forced himself to stand straight. "I need to know about the Hollow. How they're taking cities. How to stop them."

**"Need. Want."** The Dealer's form rippled. **"Always the same words. Always the same desires."**

"Will you tell me what I want to know?"

**"Perhaps."** The creature moved in strange, stuttering motions, as if skipping between moments. **"If the price is sufficient for the reward."**

"What price?"

**"That depends on what you're truly asking."** The Dealer stopped. **"Surface questions have surface costs. But deeper truths... those require more payment."**

Cassian clenched his jaw. "Then tell me what it costs to understand my enemy."

**"Your enemy."** The Dealer seemed to consider this. **"The one who leads the Hollow. The one who bears what you bear."**

"Draven Kane."

**"To understand him, you must understand what he has done. What he has taken. What he has refused to pay."**

"Then tell me. Tell me what I must pay to get this information."

**"A memory. One you cherish. One that defines you."** The Dealer extended something like a hand. **"Give me the memory of your mother's face, and I will tell you about the enemy."**

The request hit Cassian like a physical blow. His mother had died when he was seven—a fever, sudden and cruel. He barely remembered her. But her face... that was all he had left. The warmth of her smile. The color of her eyes. The way she looked when she tucked him in at night.

"That's..." He couldn't finish.

**"Too much? Then walk away. Remain ignorant while the Hollow devours everything you know."** The Dealer began to fade back into shadow. **"But know this: they are coming. Your little town will fall within the month. You will watch everyone you've tried to help become empty shells. And you will wonder, in those final moments, if the price of one memory could have saved them all."**

"Wait."

The Dealer paused.

Cassian closed his eyes. Thought of his mother. Tried to hold her face in his mind one last time. Brown eyes, he thought. Or were they green? Dark hair, streaked with early gray. A scar on her chin from a childhood accident. Or was that his grandmother?

He was already losing her. Time did that. Made the dead blur.

Maybe it was mercy to let her go completely.

"I accept," Cassian said. "Tell me how to stop them."

---

The Dealer moved with sudden, terrible speed. Its hand—if it was a hand—touched Cassian's forehead, and he felt something *tear* inside his mind. A scream built in his throat but never escaped. He saw his mother's face one last time, saw her smile down at him, heard her voice saying his name—

And then she was gone.

Not dead-gone. *Never-was* gone. Erased. When he tried to remember her now, there was only a blur where her face should be. A woman-shaped hole in his childhood. He knew she'd existed. Knew she'd loved him. But her face, her defining feature—vanished.

The loss was so profound that Cassian collapsed to his knees, gasping.

**"Good,"** the Dealer said, almost gently. **"You feel pain because the trade was fair. Now. You wanted answers? I'll give them."**

Cassian could barely speak. "The Hollow. I know they offer to take people's pain, their debts, their poverty. I know people choose emptiness over trouble. But how do they actually do it?"

**"Ah. The means. Yes. I can show you that. But understand: what you learn will make it harder to resist."**

"I'll take that risk."

**"They always do."** The Dealer's form shifted, becoming almost solid for a moment. **"The Hollow doesn't just offer escape. They offer a formal exchange. A contract. Once signed, the terms are binding."**

Cassian nodded. "The refugees mentioned it. Documents that spell out exactly what they're trading."

**"When they sign, they accept more than just peace. They accept Draven's debts. All the costs he refuses to pay—transferred into their emptied shells. They become living vessels for his corruption. He can make a thousand trades and pay nothing, because he has a thousand hollow vessels to bear the weight."**

"Seris told me he has a fragment. Like mine. But she didn't know how he corrupted it."

**"Corrupted?"** The Dealer made a sound like grinding stone. **"No. Not corrupted. The fragment remains intact. But it no longer functions as intended. The Law still requires balance, but the coin does not collect."** The Dealer leaned close. **"He found a loophole."**

"What did he do exactly?" Cassian demanded.

**The fragment is imprisoned. Caged."** The void-eyes fixed on Cassian. **"He built a prison of gold around it. Hid the coin's dark face. The face that collects payment."**

"That's..." Cassian tried to comprehend it. "That's why he doesn't pay."

**"The Law requires balance,"** the Dealer said. **"It requires that debts be paid. But it does not specify who must pay them. As long as someone pays, balance is maintained."**

Horror crept up Cassian's spine. "How? How does he make someone else—"

**"That answer costs more than you have."** The Dealer was barely visible now. **"But I will tell you this: he's been perfecting for years what you have only known about for a few days. If you face him as you are, you will lose."**

"Then how do I stop him?"

**"Stop him?"** The Dealer's voice carried something that might have been amusement. **"You cannot. Not with what little you know."**

"There has to be—"

**"He is coming for you,"** the Dealer interrupted. **"He hunts those who carry the fragments. He will sense you. Find you. And when he does, he will offer you a choice."** The voice was fading now. **"Everyone chooses."**

"Wait!" Cassian struggled to his feet. "Give me something. Anything I can use against him."

A long silence. Then, so faint Cassian almost missed it:

**"The fragments know each other. Find the others before he does, and it might be enough."**

And then the Dealer was gone, leaving Cassian alone in the ancient marketplace with a gaping hole where his mother's face used to be.

---

He didn't remember the journey back. Didn't remember climbing the stairs, emerging into the chapel, walking through the dawn-grey streets. He was in shock, moving on autopilot, his mind trying desperately to avoid the space where his mother once lived.

When he finally stumbled into the counting house, Seris was waiting.

"You paid," she said quietly.

Cassian nodded, unable to speak. He tried to picture his mother and found only a dark silhouette.

"I'm sorry," Seris said. "I know the cost is high. Your father paid a heavy cost when he came here. A memory of his wedding day. He said it was the only way to understand what he was really fighting."

Cassian's knees gave out. He sat heavily on the floor, head in his hands.

Seris knelt beside him, quiet for a long moment. Then: "What he told you...was it worthwhat you bargained for?"

Cassian considered, then nodded. "The contracts...they're accepting his debts without knowing it."

"We thought as much." She stood, offered him a hand. "Your father left records—journals, maps, everything he learned about the fragments. I've kept them hidden. If you're going to face Draven, you'll need them."

Cassian let her pull him to his feet. "Why did my father hide the fragment from the Guild?"

"Because he stopped trusting them." Seris's voice was careful. "That's all I'll say for now. When you're ready, I'll tell you more. But first, you need to recover from the price you paid. And write down what you were told."

She left before he could respond.

Cassian sat alone in the counting house as dawn light crept through the windows. He tried to remember his mother's face one more time. Tried to see her smile, hear her voice.

Nothing.

Just empty space where love used to be.

Outside, the town was waking. People going about their lives, unaware that an army of hollow shells was marching south, that someone was coming who'd offer them escape from everything they feared.

Cassian looked at the coin. His father had hidden it. Protected it. And now it was his burden.

Could he could use it without becoming what Draven had become? How could he ever compete with someone who got everything, without paying the price?

---

Three days later, a messenger arrived from the capital. The King was summoning advisors, scholars, anyone who understood trade or negotiation. He was offering a substantial reward for information about the Hollow's methods.

Cassian read the decree twice. Then he looked at the coin.

*Going to the capital means exposing myself. Draven will sense me. Will come for me.*

But the alternative was staying here while the Hollow advanced. Watching his town fall. Watching everyone he'd tried to help become empty shells.

No choice at all, really.

He began to pack.

As he worked, he found his father's final journal entry, written the day before Rowan died:

*To my son, if you are reading this: I'm sorry. Sorry for leaving you in poverty, sorry for leaving you this burden. But I believed—still believe—that these fragments aren't just tools of power. They're keys to understanding the fundamental nature of value itself. Of what matters. Of what's worth preserving in this world.*

*Draven sees them as weapons. The Guild sees them as threats. But I see them as questions: What are you willing to trade? What will you never give up? Where do you draw the line between sacrifice and self-destruction?*

*Answer those questions, Cassian. And maybe—just maybe—you'll find a way to use this gift without becoming what I feared becoming.*

*Whatever happens: know that giving you this wasn't desperation. It was hope.*

*—R.*

Cassian closed the journal. Touched the coin one last time.

Then he walked out into the morning sun, toward a capital city full of kings and nobles and enemies who didn't yet know they were already caught in Draven Kane's web.

Including him.
