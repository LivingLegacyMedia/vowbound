# Chapter 13: Seeds in Ash

The first lesson began at dawn.

Cassian found Torin in the healing ward's common room, seated at a table with his hands folded precisely in front of him. Too precisely. The placement was mechanical—fingers aligned, thumbs parallel, wrists square to the table's edge. The posture of someone following remembered instructions about "proper sitting" without understanding why.

"Good morning," Cassian said, setting down two cups of tea.

Torin looked up. "You brought tea."

"I did," Cassian confirmed, taking the seat across from him. "Do you know why?"

A pause. "No."

"Because you used to love it. Your sister told me. Said you'd drink it every morning while reading medical texts."

"I read medical texts." Torin's voice was flat, factual. "I don't remember loving anything."

Cassian set the cup in front of Torin. "Drink it."

Torin lifted the cup with mechanical precision, brought it to his lips, sipped. His expression didn't change. Nothing. Just the motion of drinking without any sense that it mattered.

"What do you taste?" Cassian asked.

"Mint. Honey. Hot water."

"And?"

"And nothing."

Cassian leaned back, studying him. This wasn't working. Three days of trying the gentle approach, and Torin was still a walking corpse. Every session the same—sipping tea, looking at objects Mira swore he'd loved, hearing stories about who he'd been. All of it sliding off him like water off stone.

"This is pointless," Cassian muttered.

"Yes," Torin agreed.

At least he was honest.

Cassian pulled both coins from his pockets. The Coin of Heads showed him what Torin had become—a collection of facts and functions with nothing connecting them. The Coin of Seeds showed him what Torin could be—but the distance between the two felt impossible to bridge with tea and pleasant memories.

Unless he tried something more direct.

Something dangerous.

"Torin," Cassian said slowly, "I'm going to try something different. It's going to hurt. Do I have your permission?"

"Will it work?"

"I don't know."

"Then it's worth trying. Nothing else has."

Cassian entered the Silent Market, that grey space between perception and reality. From here, he could see Torin's mind more clearly—not as a library but as a shattered mosaic. Thousands of pieces that had once fit together, now scattered, isolated. The image of the mint smell. The feeling of safety. The memory of his mother making tea. All there, but nothing linking them.

What if he didn't gently nurture connections? What if he forced them?

Cassian reached into his own mind, found a memory of his own mother making him tea when he was sick. Found the feeling attached to it—comfort, safety, being cared for. Then, with both coins burning hot in his palms, he pulled that fragment of feeling loose from his own memory and *pushed* it toward Torin's scattered pieces.

The pain was instant and vicious. Like tearing roots from soil. His own memory fractured, the emotion draining away, leaving only the bare fact: *Mother made me tea once. I was sick.* The warmth was gone. The comfort was gone. Just information now.

But in Torin's mind, something ignited.

The young man gasped, eyes flying wide. "I—someone—she's making tea—I'm studying and she's worried I'm working too hard—"

Then the connection collapsed, and Torin slumped forward, breathing hard.

Torin set down the cup, hands trembling slightly. "That was... difficult."

"It will get easier. And harder." Cassian pocketed the coin. "Every connection we rebuild will bring back not just good memories but painful ones. Joy and grief come together. You can't choose to feel only the pleasant parts."

"I understand." Torin looked at his shaking hands with something approaching curiosity. "My body is responding to stimulus I can't fully perceive. That's... interesting."

Despite everything, Cassian smiled. There—that word. *Interesting.* Not mechanical observation but genuine curiosity. The seed was taking root.

"Tomorrow, same time," Cassian said. "We'll practice again. And again. Until your mind remembers how to grow new connections on its own."

"How long will that take?"

"I don't know. Months, probably. Maybe longer."

Torin nodded slowly. "Then we should start again now. We're wasting time."

And there it was again—that flicker of who he'd been. Brilliant, driven, impatient with inefficiency. Buried under layers of damage but not gone. Never entirely gone.

"All right," Cassian said. "Again."

---

Cassian found Mira in the palace library, surrounded by maps of the city.

"I need your help," he said without preamble.

She looked up, surprised. "With what?"

"Hunting." Cassian spread a marked map on the table. Red circles dotted various districts. "I've been tracking Draven's emissaries for three days. There are at least eight working in Arvenstead. Maybe more. They move through markets, taverns, anywhere desperate people gather."

"You want to stop them from recruiting."

"No. I want to *reverse* them." Cassian tapped one of the circles. "The emissaries are hollow themselves. Already converted. Most of them were probably victims first—signed contracts, gave up pieces of themselves, then got recruited to spread the corruption. If I can figure out how to restore them, I cut off Draven's recruitment at the source."

Mira's eyes widened. "That's..."

"Strategic. Efficient. And exactly what we should have been doing from the start." Cassian's voice was sharp with self-recrimination. "I've been thinking too small. Trying to save individual victims one at a time while the emissaries convert dozens daily. But if I can restore the emissaries themselves? Every one I flip is dozens of future conversions prevented."

"Can you restore them the same way you're trying with Torin?"

"I don't know. But I have to try." Cassian pointed to a mark near the east market. "There's one who works the textile district. Middle-aged man. Kind eyes. Patient smile. I've watched him for two days. He approaches desperate people with perfect timing—right when they're most vulnerable, most likely to listen."

"You think you can reach him?"

"I think he's still partly human. Most of the emissaries are—they have to seem trustworthy, so Draven doesn't hollow them completely. Leaves enough personality intact to be convincing." Cassian's coins burned hot against his palms. "That's the weakness. They're not fully empty. Which means there might be something left to restore."

Mira studied the map. "This is dangerous. If you try to restore one and fail—"

"Then I've learned something. And I try differently next time." Cassian met her eyes. "Your brother's restoration is taking weeks because I'm being careful. Gentle. But I just tried something more aggressive, and it worked—briefly. What if I can do the same with emissaries? Force a connection. Plant enough of a memory that they remember being human long enough to question what they've become?"

"You'd be giving away pieces of yourself to people who've been converting others."

"Yes. But if it works, I'd be creating defectors. People who understand Draven's methods from the inside and choose to resist." Cassian's smile was cold. "Imagine an emissary who approaches desperate people and warns them away instead of recruiting them. Who knows exactly what manipulation to counter because they've used it themselves."

"Draven would kill them."

"Probably. Which is why I need to be ready to extract them immediately. Hide them. Protect them." Cassian's hand moved to the second mark on the map. "But even if each one only lasts a few days before Draven finds them, that's days of recruitment prevented. Dozens of people saved."

Mira was quiet for a moment. "You're thinking like him. Like Draven. Counting souls like coins."

"I'm thinking like a ledger-keeper. Which I am." Cassian's voice was flat. "One emissary converts, what, ten people a week? Twenty? That's a hundred people per month, per emissary. Eight emissaries in this city means eight hundred monthly conversions. If I spend all my time trying to help desperate people avoid contracts, I might save fifty. Maybe a hundred if I'm lucky. But if I can restore even one emissary? That's eight hundred people who never sign in the first place."

"The arithmetic."

"Exactly. I hate it. But ignoring it doesn't make it less true." Cassian rolled up the map. "So tonight, I'm going to try. Find the emissary. Restore enough of his humanity that he remembers what he's lost. And see if he'll help me."

"And if he attacks you instead?"

"Then I'll have learned something valuable about how much humanity has to remain before restoration is possible." Cassian pocketed the coins. "Are you coming?"

Mira hesitated. Then: "You're going to get yourself killed."

"Probably. But not today." Cassian headed for the door. "Come on. I'll show you how to spot them."

---

The emissary stood near the fountain, watching the crowd like a hunter. Cassian recognized him from two days earlier—the same patient posture, the same kind smile that never quite reached his eyes.

"He's targeting that woman," Mira whispered. "The one with the crying baby."

"I know." Cassian studied the emissary through the Coin of Heads. The man's shimmer was wrong—smoothed over, reflective but hollow beneath. Mostly empty, but not completely. There were still fragments of whoever he'd been before Draven claimed him. "Watch what he does. See how he times it."

The young mother was at her breaking point. The baby wouldn't stop screaming. The older child was pulling at her skirts, demanding food. People were staring. She looked ready to collapse.

The emissary moved.

He approached with perfect, practiced sympathy. Cassian was too far away to hear the words, but he could see the mother's expression shift from exhaustion to desperate hope. The emissary was offering something. Relief. Peace. Just sign here.

"We have to stop him," Mira started forward.

Cassian grabbed her arm. "Wait."

"But—"

"Watch."

The mother was reaching for the contract ledger. The emissary's smile widened. Then—at the last moment—she pulled her hand back. Shook her head. Gathered her children and walked away quickly, as if afraid she'd change her mind.

The emissary's smile didn't waver. He simply turned, scanning the crowd for his next target.

"He'll just find someone else," Mira said.

"I know. That's why I'm not letting him leave this market." Cassian started forward. "Stay close. If this goes wrong, run."

"What are you going to do?"

"Something stupid."

Cassian walked straight up to the emissary and grabbed his arm.

The contact was electric. Through the Coin of Heads, Cassian felt the emptiness inside the man—vast hollows where emotions should be, memories filed away but disconnected from meaning. But there, deeper, fragments remained. A name. A daughter's face. The ghost of what it felt like to care about something.

The emissary jerked back, startled. "Let go—"

"No." Cassian pulled him closer, entering the Silent Market as he did. That grey space between perception and reality snapped into focus. He could see the tether connecting the emissary to Draven's network—a thread of stolen humanity flowing outward to that vast reservoir.

And he could see what would happen if he severed it.

The emissary would collapse, screaming, as everything Draven had stripped away tried to return at once. The accumulated suffering, the guilt, the memories of everyone he'd converted rushing back in a flood that would break his mind. He'd either die or go permanently mad.

Unless Cassian did what he'd done with Torin. Held the connection temporarily. Absorbed the worst of it while the man's mind adjusted.

It would hurt. Badly. And Draven would know immediately.

"You're going to try to free me," the emissary said flatly. Not a question. "Don't. I chose this. I wanted the peace."

"You were manipulated."

"I was *saved*." The emissary's eyes were empty but his voice held conviction. "I had nothing. Was nothing. Draven gave me purpose."

"Draven made you a weapon."

"Yes. And I'm content with that." The emissary tried to pull away, but Cassian's grip tightened. "Let me go, or I'll call the others. There are six more in this market. You can't fight us all."

"I'm not here to fight." Cassian pulled both coins from his pockets. "I'm here to make you an offer."

The emissary's eyes fixed on the medallions. Recognition. Hunger. Fear. "You're the one. The one who freed the hundred. Master warned us you'd try something like this."

"Then you know I can do it. Sever your connection. Give you back what Draven took."

"I don't want it back!" The emissary's voice cracked—the first real emotion Cassian had seen from him. "You think you're saving people? You're damning them! I *remember* what it was like before. The pain. The fear. The grinding, daily horror of watching my daughter starve because I couldn't find work. Draven took that from me. Gave me peace. Purpose. Why would I choose to go back to suffering?"

"Because your daughter is still out there," Cassian said quietly. "And she still needs a father. Not a hollow shell wearing his face."

The emissary went very still.

"I can see her," Cassian said, the Coin of Heads showing him the fragments. "In your memories. Scattered pieces Draven didn't bother to erase because they weren't painful enough to matter. She's eight years old. Brown hair. Crooked front tooth. She makes you laugh when she mispronounces words. You taught her to count using buttons from your coat."

"Stop."

"Her name is Elena. And the last time you saw her—actually saw her, when you were still human—you promised you'd find a way to keep her fed. To keep her safe. Then you signed Draven's contract and traded away your love for her because the pain of failing her was too much to bear."

"I said stop!" The emissary wrenched free, stumbling backward. People were staring now. "You don't know anything about me!"

"I know you're hollow but not empty. I know there's enough of you left to restore." Cassian stepped forward. "I know that if I sever your connection right now, you'll remember everything. Elena's face. The sound of her laugh. What it felt like to love her. And yes, you'll remember the pain too. The fear. The guilt. All of it."

"Then why would I ever agree?"

"Because she's still waiting for you. And you're still her father. Even if you can't feel it anymore."

The emissary's hand moved to the contract ledger at his belt—defensive, habitual. "If you try to restore me, the network will compensate. Someone else will die. Just like before. You'll trade an innocent life for mine."

"Maybe. Probably." Cassian's voice was cold. "But you're not innocent anymore. You've converted dozens of people. Hundreds, maybe. So if the choice is between you staying hollow and converting more, or you dying but taking your corruption with you? I choose your death."

The emissary's eyes widened.

"But I don't think it has to be that way," Cassian continued. "When I freed Torin, one woman died because I didn't understand how the network compensates. I've spent every day since studying the mechanism. And I think—*think*—I can sever you without killing anyone."

"How?"

"By taking the debt myself. Temporarily. Long enough for you to stabilize." Cassian met his eyes. "It'll hurt. Both of us. And I'll be connected to Draven's network for however long it takes. Could be seconds. Could be minutes. But if it works, you'll be free. Whole. Able to remember your daughter and choose what to do about it."

"And if it doesn't work?"

"Then we both die, and Draven has one less enemy and one less recruiter." Cassian's smile was grim. "Those are the terms. Take them or leave them."

The emissary stood frozen, conflict playing across his empty features. Finally: "Why? Why risk your life for someone who's been helping destroy everything you're fighting to protect?"

"Because I'm not fighting to destroy. I'm fighting to restore." Cassian extended his hand. "And because I think there's enough of you left to save. So I'm going to try."

The emissary stared at the offered hand. At the two coins burning hot in Cassian's palm. At Mira standing behind him, ready to run or fight depending on what happened next.

"My daughter," he said quietly. "If I do this—if you restore me—will I be able to find her?"

"Yes."

"And will I still be... myself? Or will I be some broken thing that remembers being human but can't function?"

"I don't know," Cassian admitted. "Torin is functioning but incomplete. It takes time to rebuild what Draven destroyed. But you'll be *you* again. Not hollow. Not Draven's tool. Yourself."

The emissary closed his eyes. When he opened them, something had shifted. A flicker of actual emotion—fear, hope, desperation all mixed together.

"Do it," he said. "Before I lose my nerve."

Cassian grabbed his hand and plunged them both into the Silent Market.

The grey space snapped into sharp focus. Cassian could see the tether connecting the emissary to Draven's network—a pulsing thread of stolen humanity. And beyond it, the vast reservoir where thousands of hollow souls fed their essence.

The tether was thick. Old. This man had been hollow for years.

"Last chance to back out," Cassian said.

"Just do it."

Cassian wrapped his awareness around the tether and *pulled*.

The emissary screamed.

The connection resisted—years of integration making it stubborn, embedded deep. Cassian pulled harder, using both coins to amplify his strength. The Coin of Heads let him see exactly where the tether connected. The Coin of Seeds gave him the power to sever it.

The thread snapped.

Instantly, the network compensated. Debt flooded toward them—all the accumulated suffering the emissary should have been carrying, trying to find a new vessel. It crashed into the emptiness where the emissary had been, and the man convulsed, eyes rolling back.

Too much. Too fast. He was going to die.

Cassian did what he'd done with Torin—grabbed the debt himself. Pulled it into his own chest before it could destroy the emissary's fragmenting mind.

The agony was instant and overwhelming.

He felt everything the emissary had traded away. The fear of watching his daughter starve. The shame of failing as a father. The crushing weight of poverty and powerlessness. And worse—he felt the guilt. Every person the emissary had converted. Dozens of faces, dozens of lives ruined, all of it flooding into Cassian's awareness at once.

*This is what you are,* Draven's voice echoed through the network. *This is what you've become. A collector of suffering. Just like me.*

Cassian gritted his teeth and held on. The debt wanted to flow somewhere—into the emissary, into Cassian, into any available vessel. But Cassian refused to let it embed. Held it suspended, burning in his chest like hot coals.

"Stabilize," he gasped at the emissary. "Remember who you are. Find something to anchor to."

The emissary was convulsing, memories returning in a chaotic flood. His daughter's face. His wife's death. Years of decisions that had led to signing Draven's contract. The moment the locket opened and everything drained away. Then the hollow years after—converting others, spreading the corruption, becoming a tool.

"Elena," he whispered. Then louder: "Elena!"

The memory crystallized. His daughter. Eight years old. The last thing worth holding onto.

Cassian felt the emissary's identity solidify around that memory like a seed taking root. The man's mind stabilized—fragile, damaged, but coherent. Human again.

Now came the dangerous part.

Cassian had to release the debt without letting it embed in either of them. Had to let it flow back to the network but in a way that wouldn't trigger another compensation. The Law demanded balance—someone had to carry this suffering.

Unless he could convince the Law that someone already had.

Cassian pulled one of his own memories loose—the feeling of guilt he'd carried since the woman died in Draven's camp. The weight of knowing his heroism had cost an innocent life. He took that guilt, that suffering, and mixed it with the debt he was holding. Made them indistinguishable.

Then he pushed the entire mass back toward the network.

*This debt is paid,* he told the Law. *By me. By choice. Take it.*

For a moment, nothing happened. The Law considered. Evaluated. Weighed the offering against the cost.

Then it accepted.

The debt flowed out of Cassian and back into the network's reservoir. Not anchored to any specific person, but distributed among all the hollow—a tiny increase in the burden each carried, too small to trigger another death.

The transaction was complete.

Cassian gasped and fell to his knees in the real world. The Silent Market released him. He was back in the market square, surrounded by staring crowds.

The emissary lay on the ground beside him, breathing hard. Alive. Conscious. And when he opened his eyes, they weren't empty anymore.

"I remember," the emissary whispered. "Gods, I remember everything."

Then he started crying.

Mira rushed forward, helping Cassian stand. "Are you all right?"

"No." Cassian's hands were shaking. His chest ached where he'd held the debt. "But it worked. He's restored."

The emissary sat up, tears streaming down his face. "Elena. I have to—I have to find her. Is she still—?"

"She's alive," Cassian said. "In the refugee quarter. I saw her in your memories. She's been surviving by begging near the south market."

The emissary covered his face, sobbing. "I abandoned her. For *peace*. What kind of father—"

"The kind who made a terrible choice when he thought he had no other option." Cassian grabbed the man's shoulder. "But you have options now. You're human again. What you do next is up to you."

The emissary looked up, eyes red but focused. "What do you need me to do?"

"Find your daughter. Keep her safe. And if you see other emissaries approaching desperate people—warn them. Tell them what really happens when you sign. Use the fact that you've been on the inside."

"Draven will kill me when he realizes what happened."

"Probably. Which is why you need to disappear. Change your name. Leave the city if you can." Cassian pressed a small pouch of coins into his hand. "This should get you far enough away. Start over. Be a father again."

The emissary stared at the coins. "You're not keeping me here? Using me as a weapon?"

"No. I'm giving you back your life. What you do with it is your choice." Cassian met his eyes. "Though if you want to help fight Draven, I won't stop you. Just know that it'll cost you. Maybe everything."

The man nodded slowly. Then: "What's your name? I should know the name of the man who saved me."

"Cassian."

"Thank you, Cassian." The emissary stood on shaky legs. "I was—my name is Perin. Before I was hollow, I was Perin Casto. Carpenter. Father. I'd forgotten." He looked at his hands like they were foreign objects. "I'd forgotten I had a name that wasn't 'emissary.'"

"You're Perin again. Remember that."

Perin nodded and stumbled away into the crowd, heading south toward where his daughter waited.

Cassian watched him go, feeling the weight of what he'd just done. One emissary restored. Dozens of future conversions prevented. But also—one man who'd remember every life he'd ruined while hollow. Who'd carry that guilt forever.

Was that mercy? Or just a different kind of cruelty?

"That was incredible," Mira breathed. "You actually did it."

"Once." Cassian's voice was flat. "I did it once. And it nearly killed both of us. The question is whether I can do it again. And again. Eight more times just in this city."

"Can you?"

"I don't know. But I have to try." Cassian looked at the market around them. "Because you were right earlier. The arithmetic matters. One restored emissary is worth a hundred prevented conversions. That's the math I need to work with."

"And when Draven realizes what you're doing?"

"He already knows. I touched his network. He felt it." Cassian's smile was grim. "Which means he'll either fortify his emissaries against restoration, or he'll come for me directly. Either way, I need to move fast. Restore as many as I can before he adapts."

Mira was quiet for a moment. Then: "I want to learn how to do it. Restore people. Not just recognize desperation, but actually reverse what Draven's done."

"It requires the coins."

"Then teach me to use them. Or find me some other way." Her voice was fierce. "You can't do this alone. You said it yourself—you need people working in parallel. If you're restoring emissaries in Arvenstead, I could be doing the same in Rothaven. Or the Eastern Reaches."

Cassian studied her face. The determination. The desperate need to help her brother by helping others. "You're not ready."

"Then make me ready."

"It takes time—"

"We don't have time!" Mira's voice cracked. "How many people are signing contracts right now while we stand here talking? How many more will sign tomorrow? Next week? You can't save them all. You said it yourself. But maybe together we can save enough to matter."

Cassian wanted to argue. To point out all the ways she wasn't prepared, how the work would destroy her, how she'd already proven she couldn't be trusted. But he looked at her and saw something familiar—the same desperate determination he'd felt when he touched his father's coin for the first time. The need to *do something*, even if it meant sacrificing pieces of yourself.

"All right," he said finally. "I'll teach you. But we start small. Observing. Learning. You don't try to restore anyone until I'm certain you won't accidentally kill them."

"How long will that take?"

"Months. Maybe longer."

"That's too long—"

"That's how long it takes." Cassian's voice was firm. "I won't let you hurt people because you're impatient. This work requires precision. Understanding. Rush it, and you'll do more harm than Draven's emissaries."

Mira deflated slightly. "Fine. Months. But we start today."

"We start now." Cassian gestured to the market. "There are at least two more emissaries working this district. We're going to watch them. Learn their patterns. And when I've recovered enough to try again, we'll restore another one."

"And then?"

"And then we do it again. And again. Until either Draven stops us or we've restored every single one of his recruiters." Cassian's smile was cold. "He wants to play with arithmetic? Fine. Let's see how his numbers work when I'm subtracting his soldiers instead of just defending against them."

---

That night, Cassian sat with Torin in the healing ward, exhausted but wired.

"You look terrible," Torin observed.

"I restored a hollow emissary today. Took his debt into myself temporarily. It was... unpleasant."

"Did it work?"

"Yes. He's human again. Went to find his daughter."

"Good." Torin paused. "Will you do that to me? Take whatever's missing and put it back?"

"I'm trying. But your situation is different. You were severed from the network early. There's no tether to cut anymore. What you need isn't restoration—it's cultivation. Growing new connections from what's left."

"That sounds slow."

"It is."

"I don't want to be slow." Torin's voice held the first hint of frustration Cassian had heard. "I want to be fixed. *Now*."

"I know. But that's not how this works."

"Why not? You have two coins. You can do things no one else can. Why can't you just... make me whole again?"

Cassian pulled out the memory he'd planted earlier—the fragment of his own mother making tea. "Because every time I restore a piece of you, I lose a piece of me. And I don't have infinite pieces to give." He met Torin's eyes. "I'll help you rebuild. I promise. But it has to be done carefully. Sustainably. Or I'll destroy myself trying to save you."

Torin was quiet for a long moment. "That's not fair. You shouldn't have to choose between helping me and helping others."

"No. It's not fair. But it's the arithmetic I have to work with."

"I hate arithmetic."

Despite everything, Cassian laughed. "Me too. But I'm stuck with it anyway."

They sat in silence for a while. Then Torin said: "The emissary you restored. Perin. Will he stay human?"

"I don't know. The restoration worked, but I don't know if it'll last. Could be permanent. Could fade. I won't know until I check on him in a few days."

"And if it fades?"

"Then I've learned something. And I'll try differently next time." Cassian stood, wincing at the ache in his chest. "That's all any of us can do. Try. Fail. Learn. Try again."

"That also sounds slow."

"It is. But it's the only way forward." Cassian started toward the door, then paused. "Torin? Earlier today, when I planted that memory in your mind—the feeling of someone caring for you—did it feel real? Or did it feel foreign? Like it wasn't yours?"

Torin considered. "It felt... borrowed. Like wearing someone else's coat. It fit, but it wasn't *mine*."

"Good. That's what I needed to know." Cassian filed that information away. The planted memories worked but felt artificial. Which meant true restoration required growing new connections from native material, not just grafting foreign pieces. "Get some rest. Tomorrow we'll try again."

"Will we make progress?"

"Probably. A little. Enough to keep trying."

After Cassian left, Torin sat alone in the dark ward, holding the cup of cold tea.

He brought it to his nose and inhaled, trying to recapture that brief feeling from earlier. The sense of safety. Of someone nearby who cared.

Nothing.

But he remembered that it had happened. That for a brief moment, he'd felt something more than empty observation.

And if it had happened once, it could happen again.

So tomorrow, he'd try again.

It was slow. It was frustrating. But it was better than accepting permanent emptiness.

Torin took a sip of the cold tea, searching for meaning in the taste.

Still nothing.

But he'd keep trying.

Because somewhere deep in his fragmented mind, something remembered what it felt like to hope.

And that was enough to keep him drinking tea every morning with a stranger who'd traded pieces of himself to plant seeds in ash.

Hoping they'd grow into something worth being.

---

Miles away, in a tent on the edge of Hollow territory, Draven Kane opened his golden locket and smiled.

"Perin Casto," he murmured to the imprisoned coin inside. "Restored after three years of loyal service. How... inconvenient."

One of his lieutenants—a woman who'd been hollow for seven years—stood nearby. "Should we retrieve him? Kill him?"

"No. Let him run. Let him hide." Draven's smile widened. "Cassian thinks he's discovered a winning strategy. Restoring my emissaries one by one. Cutting off my recruitment."

"Isn't he?"

"Oh, it's brilliant. Tactically sound. Exactly what I'd do in his position." Draven closed the locket with a soft click. "Which is why I want him to keep doing it."

The lieutenant frowned—as much as her hollow face could frown. "I don't understand."

"Every time Cassian restores one of my people, he has to touch my network. Connect to my reservoir. Carry debt that should have destroyed them." Draven's eyes gleamed. "He thinks he's subtracting my soldiers. But every restoration brings him one step closer to becoming like me. One step closer to understanding that emptiness isn't corruption—it's peace."

"You want him to restore your emissaries?"

"I want him to try. I want him to succeed, over and over, until he's so deeply connected to my network that he can't tell where he ends and it begins." Draven pulled out a map of the Covenant territories. "How many emissaries do we have who are... expendable? Ones who've outlived their usefulness but still appear valuable?"

"Dozens. Maybe more."

"Good. Make sure they're positioned where Cassian can find them. Make it look challenging but achievable. Let him think he's winning." Draven's smile was cold. "And when he's restored enough of them, when he's touched my network enough times, when he's carried enough of my debt..."

"Then what?"

"Then I'll offer him a choice. Keep fighting and destroy himself piece by piece. Or accept what he's becoming and join me. Stop resisting the inevitable." Draven touched the locket almost lovingly. "He'll choose wrong. They always do. And when he finally signs his name in my ledger, I'll have both his coins. And the Covenant will fall within a month."

The lieutenant nodded. "I'll position the emissaries."

"Do that. And send word to our people in Arvenstead—don't interfere with Cassian's hunting. Let him have his victories. Small ones. Meaningless ones. Let him think he's found the path forward." Draven returned to his maps, already calculating. "The young Champion is smart. Determined. He'll fight until there's nothing left to fight with. Which makes him exactly the kind of enemy I can use."

In the distance, thunder rumbled. Rain began to fall on the tent—cold, steady, relentless.

Draven listened to it and smiled.

Storms always came eventually.

And he'd built his empire in the rain.
