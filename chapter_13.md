# Chapter 13: The Price of Victory

They found Torin exactly where they'd left him.

Cassian and Mira burst into the healing ward three days after the liberation, road-worn and desperate, and there he was—sitting by the window in the same position, wearing the same hollow expression, staring at his hands like they were fascinating foreign objects.

Mira stopped in the doorway. Her face went gray.

"No," she whispered. "No—"

"Mira." Torin turned slowly, his voice flat. "You're back."

She rushed to him, grabbed his shoulders, searched his eyes for something—anything—that looked different. "Tell me you feel different. Tell me something changed. Tell me you're better—"

"I don't understand." Torin frowned with mild confusion. "Should something have changed?"

Mira's hands fell away. She stepped back like she'd been struck. "A hundred Hollow were freed three days ago. I thought—I hoped—"

"I wasn't changed with them." Torin said it simply, without emotion.

Cassian felt something cold and heavy settle in his chest. He'd known, logically, that it was unlikely Torin would be included.

But knowing it intellectually and seeing the hope drain from Mira's face were two different things.

"Why?" Mira's voice broke. "Why couldn't you have freed him? You freed a hundred people—why not him?"

"Because I severed his tether days ago," Cassian said quietly. "When I pulled him out of the network in that tent. He wasn't bound anymore. Wasn't part of the Hollow like the others."

"So your first rescue damned him?" Mira's voice rose, sharp with anger and grief. "If you'd just left him alone, left him hollow and suffering for a few more weeks, he would have been freed with the others? He'd be whole right now?"

The words hit like a physical blow. Cassian had saved Torin early—partially, incompletely—and that act of mercy had excluded him from the complete restoration later. If he'd done nothing, waited, let Torin suffer in the network just a little longer...

But he caught himself. The logic was tempting but incomplete.

"Maybe," Cassian said slowly. "But it was only because we rescued him that Draven was able to send you that message—it's why you stole the coin—and it's why I was able to free the hundred. If we'd left him hollow, perhaps none of that would have happened." He met her eyes. "I don't know what would have happened, Mira. I only know what did happen. What did happen is that I tried to save your brother, and it wasn't enough."

Mira stared at him. Then she laughed—a broken, desperate sound. "So my brother is damned. Not hollow enough to be freed. Not whole enough to be human. Trapped in some middle state because you—" She stopped, breathing hard. "Because we both tried to save him too soon."

"I can still try to help him," Cassian said. But even as he spoke, he wasn't sure how much he could really do.

Mira whirled on him. "Can you? Because it seems like every time you 'fix' something, you break it in new ways. You pulled him from the network—great. Now he's stuck. You freed a hundred Hollow—wonderful. But not him. So what's your next brilliant solution? Wait another few months and hope a third option presents itself?"

"Stop." Cassian's voice was cold. Hard. "Just stop."

Mira blinked, startled by his tone.

"You want to blame me?" Cassian stood, and there was something dangerous in his posture. "Fine. Let's talk about blame. You stole from me. Lied to me. Manipulated me into risking my life at that camp in the first place. And I went anyway. I saved your brother—partially, yes, but I *saved him*. Then I freed a hundred others using a desperate gamble that almost got me killed. And now you're angry that your brother wasn't magically included in a trade he had no connection to?"

"I didn't—"

"You didn't what? Betray me? Because you did. You didn't ask for my help—you stole from me. You didn't trust me to care about Torin—you assumed I wouldn't, so you manipulated me into it." His voice rose, years of suppressed anger finally breaking through. "And even after all that, I'm still here. Still trying to help him. Still offering to help him. So don't you dare stand there and blame me for not doing enough."

Mira's face had gone pale. "I just—"

"You just what? Expected miracles? Expected me to wave my hand and undo everything Draven did? I'm not a god, Mira. I'm a man with two relics and more problems than I can solve. I've done everything I could for Torin. Everything. And it wasn't enough—but that doesn't make it my fault. It makes it Draven's fault. And yours, for stealing from the one person who might have helped you if you'd just been honest."

The words hung in the air like smoke. Harsh. True. Painful.

Mira sank into her chair, covering her face. "You're right," she whispered. "You're absolutely right. I have no right to blame you. No right to be angry at you when you've done nothing but try to help." She looked up, tears streaming. "But I don't know who else to be angry at. Draven's not here. And my brother can't even understand why I'm upset. So I'm lashing out at you because you're the only target I have."

"That's not fair to me," Cassian said.

"I know," Mira said. "Nothing about this is fair. Not to you. Not to Torin. Not to anyone." She wiped her face roughly. "I'm sorry. Again. I know it doesn't mean much, but I'm sorry."

Torin watched the exchange with his characteristic flatness, head tilted like he was observing an interesting experiment rather than his sister's breakdown.

"Why is she angry?" he asked Cassian.

"Because she loves you," Cassian said. "And love makes people irrational when they're afraid of losing what they love."

"That sounds backward."

Mira made a sound between a laugh and a sob. "Backward. He thinks love is *backward*." She looked at her brother, tears streaming. "This is what I traded everything for. This hollow shell who can't even understand why I'm crying."

"I'm not hollow," Torin said mildly. "Cassian said so. I'm 'incomplete.' Different from the others."

"Lucky you," Mira said bitterly.

Cassian knelt before Torin, both coins warming in his pockets. He let his perception expand, examining what remained of the young man's humanity with both fragments of divine power.

The Coin of Heads showed him the damage: neural pathways severed, emotional connections disrupted, memories stored but inaccessible. Like a library where all the books existed but the index had been destroyed. Everything was there—just scattered, isolated, unable to integrate. He could see Torin's memories of his sister—dozens of them, bright and vivid—but they floated independently, disconnected from the emotional context that would make them meaningful. Torin remembered *events* with Mira, but not the *feeling* of having a sister.

The Coin of Seeds showed him something else: potential. Raw, unformed potential. Like a burned forest where new shoots were already trying to push through ash. The capacity for growth, for reconnection, for rebuilding what had been lost. The ship had sailed on restoration—that chance vanished when Cassian severed the original tether. But cultivation remained possible. Patient, deliberate growth of new pathways, new connections, new ways of being human.

Cassian reached out carefully with the Coin of Seeds, feeding the barest thread of energy into one of those nascent connections—a pathway between memory and emotion, trying to link what Torin remembered about Mira to how he should *feel* about her.

For a moment, something flickered in Torin's eyes. Recognition—of his sister's face, yes, but deeper: what she *meant*.

Then it faded, the connection too fragile to sustain itself without constant reinforcement.

Mira gasped softly. "Did you see that? His eyes—they changed for a second—"

"I saw it," Cassian said quietly. He pulled back, the energy dissipating. "It's proof the work can succeed. The connections can be rebuilt. It just takes time."

Torin blinked slowly, looking confused. "Something felt... different. I don't know what."

"That's good," Cassian told him. "That's the beginning."

It would take months. Maybe years. Hundreds of sessions like this, patiently nurturing one connection at a time until enough existed to create something resembling wholeness. And there was no guarantee it would work.

But it was the only option left.

"I can help you," Cassian said to Torin. "Not fix you—I can't undo what's been done. But I can teach you to reconnect to your mind...your humanity. Rebuild yourself piece by piece. It'll take time—"

"How much time?" Mira's voice was sharp.

"I don't know. Maybe months. Maybe years."

"Years." She laughed again, that broken sound. "Years of what? Daily lessons? Meditation? Hoping that eventually enough fragments connect that he becomes something resembling human?"

"Yes," Cassian said simply. "That's exactly what it means."

"And what if it doesn't work? What if we spend years trying and he stays exactly like this?"

"Then he stays like this," Cassian met her eyes. "But at least we tried. At least we gave him the chance to choose what he becomes rather than leaving him trapped in what he is."

Torin raised his hand like a student in a lecture. "I'd like to try."

Both Mira and Cassian turned to him, startled.

"You would?" Mira asked.

"Yes. I don't remember why, but something tells me I used to be someone who tried things. Who solved problems. Who didn't give up." Torin frowned, struggling with concepts that should be simple. "I don't know if I want to be whole again. But I'd like to know what 'whole' feels like. So I can decide if I want it."

He paused, tilting his head in that characteristic way. "Though I should clarify—I don't entirely understand why it matters so much to you. This version of me is efficient. Logical. I can observe patterns, catalog information, solve problems without emotional interference." His gaze moved between Mira and Cassian, analytically. "I don't suffer the way Mira does. Don't experience the confusion or pain that emotions seem to cause. Sometimes I think..." He trailed off, searching for the right words. "Sometimes I think I might prefer it this way."

Mira's face went pale. "You prefer being broken?"

"I don't think I'm broken," Torin said calmly. "I think I'm different. And different isn't necessarily worse." He looked at his hands. "When I catalog guard schedules or map building layouts, I don't get distracted by fear or hope. When I analyze a problem, I don't second-guess myself with doubt. There's a purity to it. A clarity."

"That's not living, Torin. That's just... existing."

"Is there a meaningful difference?" Torin asked, genuinely curious. "From my perspective, you spend half your time suffering because of emotions you can't control. Love makes you cry. Fear makes you hesitate. Anger makes you irrational. Why would I want to return to that?"

Cassian watched the exchange, something heavy settling in his chest. This was the real problem—not that Torin couldn't be restored, but that he might not want to be. The person who would choose restoration didn't exist anymore. And the person who did exist saw emotions as weaknesses to be avoided.

"Because those emotions are what make you *you*," Mira said desperately. "The real you. My brother. Not this... this calculating machine wearing his face."

Torin considered this. "But the 'real me' doesn't exist anymore. He was destroyed when I opened that locket. What remains is... this. And this version doesn't want what you want. Doesn't feel what you feel." He paused. "Though I'll admit, I don't like that I can't understand why that upsets you so much. Like there's a problem I should be able to solve, but I can't even understand what it is."

"That's exactly it," Cassian said quietly. "You can identify that there's something missing, even if you can't feel the absence. That awareness—that's the part of you that's still reaching for wholeness, even if you don't understand why."

Torin looked at him. "You think the desire to understand my own gaps is evidence of humanity?"

"I think it proves you're less content with this state than you believe. If you were truly satisfied being this way, you wouldn't be curious about what you're missing. You'd simply exist. Efficiently. Without questions."

For a long moment, Torin was silent. Then: "That's annoyingly logical."

Cassian felt the corners of his mouth lift. There—*there* was a flicker of the person Torin had been. Brilliant, curious, methodical. Buried under layers of damage but not gone. Not entirely.

"Then we'll start tomorrow," Cassian said. "One hour each day. I'll teach you to sense the gaps in your mind, recognize what's missing, and practice growing new connections. It'll be hard. Probably frustrating. And you might decide partway through that you prefer the clarity of this state to the messiness of emotions. That's your choice. But at least you'll make it knowing what both options actually feel like."

"That seems fair," Torin said. Then, with the faintest hint of something that might have been concern: "And if I do decide I prefer staying this way? Will Mira hate me for it?"

The question hung in the air. Mira's breath caught.

"No," she said finally, voice thick. "I could never hate you, Torin. Even if you choose to stay like this. Even if you decide that emotions aren't worth the pain." She wiped her eyes roughly. "I'll be heartbroken. I'll probably cry about it for months. But I won't hate you. You're still my brother. Whatever you choose to become."

Torin nodded slowly, processing this. "That seems... inefficient. Loving someone regardless of whether they can love you back."

"Yes," Mira laughed through tears. "Love is very inefficient. Welcome to being human—or at least, learning about it."

"I don't want to be broken forever," Torin said quietly, as if the thought had just occurred to him. "I want to understand what I'm missing. Even if I ultimately decide I don't want it back."

Mira's face crumpled. She reached for her brother, pulled him into a desperate embrace. "You're not broken, Torin. You're just... unwell. And we're going to help you understand. Together."

Torin patted her shoulder awkwardly, mechanically. "You're crying again. Is this still about love?"

"Yes," Mira sobbed. "It's still about love."

Cassian stood, giving them space. He'd offered what he could—time, effort, patient cultivation of something that might never fully bloom. 

He stepped into the hallway, letting the door close softly behind him. For a moment he just stood there, exhaustion settling into his bones. The confrontation with Mira. The weight of Torin's condition. The impossible task of rebuilding a broken mind, slowly, step by step.

*One problem at a time,* he thought, leaning against the wall. *First Torin. Then everything else.*

He'd barely caught his breath when a royal guard appeared at the end of the corridor, armor gleaming in the afternoon light. "Master Cassian. The King requests your presence. In the Great Hall."

The Great Hall. Not the private study.

That meant ceremony. Politics. Theater.

Cassian closed his eyes briefly, gathering himself. Then nodded. "Lead the way."

---

When the massive oak doors swung open, Cassian understood why.

The hall was packed. Nobles, merchants, military commanders, foreign dignitaries—hundreds of people crammed into the space, all turning to watch as he entered.

King Aldric stood on the dais in full ceremonial regalia. Beside him stood four other figures in royal dress—the rulers of the other kingdoms in the nascent Covenant.

"Master Cassian Erevan," the King's voice boomed across the hall. "Approach."

Cassian walked forward, hyperaware of every eye tracking his movement. The crowd murmured—some in awe, some in skepticism, some in outright hostility. He recognized a few faces from his earlier audiences: Lord Corvan, still recovering from having his memories extracted. General Therin, who'd said the coin should be taken from him. Other military leaders who'd called him a charlatan.

None of them were murmuring anymore.

"Three days ago," King Aldric continued, "this man infiltrated the Hollow's largest encampment. Alone save for one companion, he penetrated their defenses, identified their command structure, and performed a miracle that liberated one hundred souls from Draven Kane's network."

The murmur grew louder. Cassian heard fragments:
"—impossible—"
"—a real victory—"
"—war hero—"

"One hundred people," the King repeated, letting it sink in. "Restored completely. Memories intact. Humanity returned. The first reversal of the hollowing process in recorded history." He looked directly at Cassian. "Tell us. How was it accomplished?"

Cassian's mouth was dry. This wasn't a private debriefing. This was political theater. The King was using his victory to legitimize the Covenant, to rally support, to prove that Draven could be beaten.

And Cassian was the prop.

But he was also smart enough not to hand them ammunition against himself.

"Through understanding Draven's methods," Cassian said carefully, his voice carrying across the sudden silence. "The Hollow are bound by connections—invisible threads that tie them to their master's will. I found a way to disrupt those connections. Temporarily. Long enough for their humanity to reassert itself."

"How?" someone called from the crowd. "What method?"

"The specifics are... complex," Cassian said carefully, which was true. "And dangerous if misunderstood or misapplied. What matters is that the process can be reversed. That Draven's network has weaknesses. That those he claims are lost forever can be saved."

"You gave something up, didn't you?" another voice called—one of the merchants. "Made some kind of deal with the Devil?"

Cassian almost smiled at how close that was to the truth. "The details of what I traded are personal. What I can tell you is that it was costly, and it worked."

A woman near the front—someone who'd lost family to the Hollow, judging by her expression—spoke up. "Will they stay free? Or will Draven be able to reclaim them?"

That was the real question. The one that kept Cassian awake at night.

"I severed their connections to his network," Cassian said honestly. "Those specific bonds are broken. But could Draven convert them again if they signed another contract with one of his emissaries? If they fell for the same lies a second time? Yes. Which is why we need to protect them. Educate them. Make sure they understand what they escaped."

The woman nodded slowly, seeming satisfied with that answer.

"But can you teach this method?" That was a noble Cassian didn't recognize. "Can others learn to do what you've done?"

Cassian felt the trap in the question. Say yes, and they'd demand he reveal his secrets, potentially creating dangers if the knowledge was misused. Say no, and they'd see him as hoarding power, becoming indispensable, maybe even threatening.

"The method requires tools most don't possess," Cassian said diplomatically. "And carries risks that could prove catastrophic if handled incorrectly. But I'm committed to finding ways to replicate the success. Safely. In time."

More murmurs. Some impressed. Some frustrated by the vagueness.

"Can you do it again?" That was General Therin, stepping forward. "Free another hundred? Another thousand?"

Cassian met his gaze steadily. "Not the same way. Draven will have adapted his defenses by now—strengthened the bindings, added protections against the method I used. What worked once through surprise won't work twice against an enemy who knows it's coming." He paused, letting that sink in. "But there are other approaches. Different tactics. The key is that we now know the network *can* be disrupted. That gives us options we didn't have before."

"Spoken like someone avoiding the real question," Therin said bluntly. "Can you free more Hollow or not?"

"Yes," Cassian said, choosing his words carefully. "But we'll need patience. Infiltrating camps and freeing hundreds at once—that door is closed. What remains is slower work—surgical strikes against Draven's agents, preventing new conversions, freeing individuals when opportunities arise. Less dramatic, perhaps, but sustainable. And that's how we actually win this war."

The General's face darkened, but he couldn't argue with the logic.

"For the first time," King Aldric continued, "we have proof the process can be reversed. That Draven's network has weaknesses. That those we thought lost can be saved." He gestured to the other monarchs. "Which is why we formalize the Covenant today. Five kingdoms, united against the Hollow's advance."

The four other rulers stepped forward—Queen Mirelle of Rothaven, Emperor Kast of the Eastern Reaches, High Chieftain Vara of the Northern Clans, and Lord Regent Thane of the Southern Territories. Each spoke briefly of pledged resources, open borders, coordinated intelligence.

Cassian barely heard them. He was watching the crowd. Some faces showed hope. Others skepticism. And a few—like the King's General—showed barely concealed hostility.

"And we pledge our support to you, Master Cassian," King Aldric said, recapturing his attention. "As the Covenant's official agent. You will have authority to move freely across all five kingdoms, to requisition resources, to act in our names when hunting those who spread the Hollow's corruption."

They were giving him power—and responsibility. The burden of five kingdoms' hopes resting on his ability to do the impossible again and again.

"I accept," Cassian said.

"Then kneel," the King commanded.

Cassian knelt. A ceremonial sword touched his shoulders. Words were spoken—titles, pledges, expectations. The crowd applauded. Some genuine. Some resentful that a commoner was being elevated above nobles who'd trained their whole lives for such recognition.

When Cassian stood, the weight of their expectations felt heavier than any ceremonial blade.

---

Hours later, Cassian escaped to a balcony overlooking the city. Below, the celebration continued—music, laughter, wine flowing freely. Inside, commanders were still trying to corner him with questions about strategy and next steps.

Mira found him there, nursing a cup of wine.

"Champion of the Realm," she said without looking at him. "Very dramatic."

"It's theater," Cassian said. "Politics. They need a symbol."

"And you're it." She took a long drink. "Do they know you can't repeat what you did? That your brilliant strategy was a desperate gamble?"

"No. And I'm not going to tell them." Cassian leaned against the railing. "They need hope right now. I'll give them that. And find another way to actually win."

Mira finally looked at him. Her eyes were still red from crying, but something had shifted. Not forgiveness—she wasn't there yet. But perhaps acceptance. The grief compartmentalized enough to think strategically again.

"I'm sorry," she said. "For earlier. For blaming you when you've done nothing but try to help."

"I know."

"And I meant what I said. About not betraying you again. About wanting to help."

He watched her face, trying to gauge sincerity versus desperation. "Help how?"

"Hunt them." Mira met his eyes. "Draven's emissaries. They spread through cities, offering trades to desperate people. What if we intercept them? Find the emissaries before they can convert more victims."

"We can't repeat the mass liberation," Cassian said slowly. "But we could prevent new conversions. Cut off his recruitment at the source."

"Exactly. Shift tactics. Become surgical instead of dramatic. Hunt his agents one by one, city by city."

Cassian felt the pieces clicking together—the Covenant's authority giving him freedom to travel, the two coins letting him sense Draven's agents, and Mira's tactical mind helping plan operations.

"I can't be everywhere at once," Cassian said. "Draven has agents in dozens of cities."

"That's why you need help." Mira leaned forward. "Train people to act in your name. Teach me—teach others—how to recognize Draven's agents, how to counter their methods, how to offer desperate people better alternatives. You understand how desperation works. That knowledge doesn't require your coins. It just requires your insight."

He considered this, turning it over in his mind. "What you're describing is essentially creating our own network. Emissaries who can identify vulnerable people before Draven's agents reach them. Who understand the psychology of desperation well enough to offer genuine hope instead of false promises."

"Exactly. Draven's preachers work because they understand what people need to hear when they're desperate. They offer easy solutions to impossible problems. But what if we reach those people first? Offer them real help instead of contracts?"

"It would take time," Cassian said slowly. "Training people to recognize manipulation without becoming manipulators themselves. Teaching them to see desperation without exploiting it. That's a narrow line to walk."

"But it's the only way to scale," Mira pressed. "You can't be in every city personally. But if you had ten people who understood your methods? Twenty? Spread across the Covenant? You'd be cutting off Draven's recruitment while he's still trying to figure out how you freed those hundred Hollow."

Cassian felt the pieces coming together. It was brilliant—and dangerous. Creating a counter-network to fight Draven's network. People who understood the same psychological principles but used them to offer genuine alternatives instead of enslaving desperate souls.

"You want to be the first," he said.

"I want to help Torin. And I want to make up for what I did." Mira's voice was fierce. "Let me be useful. Let me earn back some fraction of trust by actually helping."

"While also learning enough to eventually help Torin yourself."

"Yes," Mira admitted. "Learning what you know can help me with both."

Cassian was quiet for a long moment. Then: "You'll start small. Here in Arvenstead. Learning to identify vulnerable people, offering them hope before Draven's agents reach them. You don't hunt preachers until I'm confident you won't become one yourself."

"Fair."

"And if you use what I teach to exploit people—if I see even a hint of manipulation—"

"You'll destroy me," Mira finished. "And I'd deserve it."

Cassian held out his hand. "Then we have a deal."

Mira shook it. "Thank you."

"Don't thank me yet. This work changes you. Watching desperate people make terrible choices every day... it'll make you cynical. Make you wonder if anyone can be saved."

"Then we'll remind each other," Mira said quietly. "When you doubt, I'll remind you that you freed a hundred people. When I doubt, you'll remind me that my brother is still worth fighting for."

Despite everything, Cassian found himself smiling slightly. "Deal."

---

Later that night, Cassian stood alone in his quarters, both coins warming his palms.

Champion of the Covenant. War hero. The one person five kingdoms believed could turn the tide.

And all he had was two relics, a broken man to heal, a betrayer to train, and no clear path to victory.

*This is what Father passed to me,* he thought. *Not just power. The weight of impossible expectations.*

But he'd accepted it. Knelt before five kings. And now he had to figure out how to deserve the title.

The coins pulsed in his hands—one showing him value and exchange, the other showing him growth and potential. Together, they revealed a path forward—through persistent, methodical work. Hunting preachers. Healing broken people. Building resistance one small act at a time.

It wasn't heroic. But it was honest. And it might actually work.

Tomorrow, he'd start teaching Torin to rebuild himself from fragments.

The day after, he'd start teaching Mira to recognize desperation before it could be exploited.

And every day after that, he'd hunt. City by city. One victim at a time.

*Until either Draven falls or I do.*

Cassian set down the coins, their warmth fading from his palms. 

Tomorrow, the real work began—the patient, invisible labor of rebuilding what Draven had broken, one mind, one city, one desperate soul at a time.

He closed his eyes and felt the weight of the Covenant's expectations settle around him like a cloak.

He'd earned his title through one desperate gamble.

Now he had to prove he deserved it.

And somewhere out there, in a city he couldn't see, Draven was already planning his next move.
