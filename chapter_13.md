# Chapter 13: Seeds in Ash

The first lesson began at dawn.

Cassian found Torin in the healing ward's common room, seated at a table with his hands folded precisely in front of him. Too precisely. The placement was mechanical—fingers aligned, thumbs parallel, wrists square to the table's edge. The posture of someone following remembered instructions about "proper sitting" without understanding why.

"Good morning," Cassian said, setting down two cups of tea.

Torin looked up. "You brought tea."

"I did," Cassian confirmed, taking the seat across from him. "Do you know why?"

A pause. "No."

"Because you used to love it. Your sister told me. Said you'd drink it every morning while reading medical texts."

"I read medical texts." Torin's voice was flat, factual. "I don't remember loving anything."

Cassian set the cup in front of Torin. "Drink it."

Torin lifted the cup with mechanical precision, brought it to his lips, sipped. His expression didn't change. Nothing. Just the motion of drinking without any sense that it mattered.

"What do you taste?" Cassian asked.

"Mint. Honey. Hot water."

"And?"

"And nothing."

Cassian leaned back, studying him. This wasn't working. Three days of trying the gentle approach, and Torin was still a walking corpse. Every session the same—sipping tea, looking at objects Mira swore he'd loved, hearing stories about who he'd been. All of it sliding off him like water off stone.

"This is pointless," Cassian muttered.

"Yes," Torin agreed.

At least he was honest.

Cassian pulled both coins from his pockets. The Coin of Heads showed him what Torin had become—a collection of facts and functions with nothing connecting them. The Coin of Seeds showed him what Torin could be—but the distance between the two felt impossible to bridge with tea and pleasant memories.

Unless he tried something more direct.

Something dangerous.

"Torin," Cassian said slowly, "I'm going to try something different. It's going to hurt. Do I have your permission?"

"Will it work?"

"I don't know."

"Then it's worth trying. Nothing else has."

Cassian entered the Silent Market, that grey space between perception and reality. From here, he could see Torin's mind more clearly—not as a library but as a shattered mosaic. Thousands of pieces that had once fit together, now scattered, isolated. The image of the mint smell. The feeling of safety. The memory of his mother making tea. All there, but nothing linking them.

What if he didn't try to replace what was lost? What if he simply *connected* his mind to Torin's—let the young man borrow his mental fortitude long enough to see the pattern of what wholeness looked like?

Cassian reached out carefully with both coins, creating a bridge between his awareness and Torin's fragmented consciousness. Not forcing his memories into Torin's mind, but letting Torin *see through his eyes* for a moment. Showing him what it felt like to have connections intact.

The contact was disorienting. Cassian felt Torin's emptiness trying to pull at him—the hollowness wanting to equalize, to drain some of his wholeness into that void. But the Coin of Heads anchored him, gave him the mental strength to withstand it. He held the connection steady.

Through their link, Torin could sense the intact pathways in Cassian's mind. Memory connected to emotion. Sensation linked to meaning. Everything working together as it should.

"Do you see it?" Cassian asked quietly. "How the pieces fit together?"

The young man gasped, eyes flying wide. "Yes. I—it's like—there's a pattern. The tea smell connects to—safety, and that connects to—someone caring, and—" His voice trembled. "I had this once. I *know* I had this."

"You did. And you can again." Cassian showed him one of Torin's own scattered memories—his mother making tea while he studied. "This is yours. Not mine. Can you feel how it wants to connect to the feeling of being cared for?"

For a moment, Torin grasped it. The memory and emotion drew together like magnets, clicking into place. Comfort flooded through him—real, his own, genuine.

Then the connection collapsed as Cassian withdrew, and Torin slumped forward, breathing hard.

Torin set down the cup, hands trembling slightly. "That was... difficult."

"It will get easier. And harder." Cassian pocketed the coin. "Every connection we rebuild will bring back not just good memories but painful ones. Joy and grief come together. You can't choose to feel only the pleasant parts."

"I understand." Torin looked at his shaking hands with something approaching curiosity. "My body is responding to stimulus I can't fully perceive. That's... interesting."

Despite everything, Cassian smiled. There—that word. *Interesting.* Not mechanical observation but genuine curiosity. The seed was taking root.

"Tomorrow, same time," Cassian said. "We'll practice again. And again. Until your mind remembers how to grow new connections on its own."

"How long will that take?"

"I don't know. Months, probably. Maybe longer."

Torin nodded slowly. "Then we should start again now. We're wasting time."

And there it was again—that flicker of who he'd been. Brilliant, driven, impatient with inefficiency. Buried under layers of damage but not gone. Never entirely gone.

"All right," Cassian said. "Again."

---

Cassian found Mira in the palace library, surrounded by maps of the city.

"I need your help," he said without preamble.

She looked up, surprised. "With what?"

"Hunting." Cassian spread a marked map on the table. Red circles dotted various districts. "I've been tracking Draven's emissaries for three days. There are at least eight working in Arvenstead. Maybe more. They move through markets, taverns, anywhere desperate people gather."

"You want to stop them from recruiting."

"No. I want to *reverse* them." Cassian tapped one of the circles. "The emissaries are hollow themselves. Already converted. Most of them were probably victims first—signed contracts, gave up pieces of themselves, then got recruited to spread the corruption. If I can figure out how to restore them, I cut off Draven's recruitment at the source."

Mira's eyes widened. "That's..."

"Strategic. Efficient. And exactly what we should have been doing from the start." Cassian's voice was sharp with self-recrimination. "I've been thinking too small. Trying to save individual victims one at a time while the emissaries convert dozens daily. But if I can restore the emissaries themselves? Every one I flip is dozens of future conversions prevented."

"Can you restore them the same way you're trying with Torin?"

"I don't know. But I have to try." Cassian pointed to a mark near the east market. "There's one who works the textile district. Middle-aged man. Kind eyes. Patient smile. I've watched him for two days. He approaches desperate people with perfect timing—right when they're most vulnerable, most likely to listen."

"You think you can reach him?"

"I think he's still partly human. Most of the emissaries are—they have to seem trustworthy, so Draven doesn't hollow them completely. Leaves enough personality intact to be convincing." Cassian's coins burned hot against his palms. "That's the weakness. They're not fully empty. Which means there might be something left to restore."

Mira studied the map. "This is dangerous. If you try to restore one and fail—"

"Then I've learned something. And I try differently next time." Cassian met her eyes. "Your brother's restoration is taking weeks because I'm being careful. Gentle. But I just tried something more aggressive, and it worked—briefly. What if I can do the same with emissaries? Force a connection. Plant enough of a memory that they remember being human long enough to question what they've become?"

"You'd be giving away pieces of yourself to people who've been converting others."

"Yes. But if it works, I'd be creating defectors. People who understand Draven's methods from the inside and choose to resist." Cassian's smile was cold. "Imagine an emissary who approaches desperate people and warns them away instead of recruiting them. Who knows exactly what manipulation to counter because they've used it themselves."

"Draven would kill them."

"Probably. Which is why I need to be ready to extract them immediately. Hide them. Protect them." Cassian's hand moved to the second mark on the map. "But even if each one only lasts a few days before Draven finds them, that's days of recruitment prevented. Dozens of people saved."

Mira was quiet for a moment. "You're thinking like him. Like Draven. Counting souls like coins."

"I'm thinking like a ledger-keeper. Which I am." Cassian's voice was flat. "One emissary converts, what, ten people a week? Twenty? That's a hundred people per month, per emissary. Eight emissaries in this city means eight hundred monthly conversions. If I spend all my time trying to help desperate people avoid contracts, I might save fifty. Maybe a hundred if I'm lucky. But if I can restore even one emissary? That's eight hundred people who never sign in the first place."

"The arithmetic."

"Exactly. I hate it. But ignoring it doesn't make it less true." Cassian rolled up the map. "So tonight, I'm going to try. Find the emissary. Restore enough of his humanity that he remembers what he's lost. And see if he'll help me."

"And if he attacks you instead?"

"Then I'll have learned something valuable about how much humanity has to remain before restoration is possible." Cassian pocketed the coins. "Are you coming?"

Mira hesitated. Then: "You're going to get yourself killed."

"Probably. But not today." Cassian headed for the door. "Come on. I'll show you how to spot them."

---

The emissary stood near the fountain, watching the crowd like a hunter. Cassian recognized him from two days earlier—the same patient posture, the same kind smile that never quite reached his eyes.

"He's targeting that woman," Mira whispered. "The one with the crying baby."

"I know." Cassian studied the emissary through the Coin of Heads. The man's shimmer was wrong—smoothed over, reflective but hollow beneath. Mostly empty, but not completely. There were still fragments of whoever he'd been before Draven claimed him. "Watch what he does. See how he times it."

The young mother was at her breaking point. The baby wouldn't stop screaming. The older child was pulling at her skirts, demanding food. People were staring. She looked ready to collapse.

The emissary moved.

He approached with perfect, practiced sympathy. Cassian was too far away to hear the words, but he could see the mother's expression shift from exhaustion to desperate hope. The emissary was offering something. Relief. Peace. Just sign here.

"We have to stop him," Mira started forward.

Cassian grabbed her arm. "Wait."

"But—"

"Watch."

The mother was reaching for the contract ledger. The emissary's smile widened. Then—at the last moment—she pulled her hand back. Shook her head. Gathered her children and walked away quickly, as if afraid she'd change her mind.

The emissary's smile didn't waver. He simply turned, scanning the crowd for his next target.

"He'll just find someone else," Mira said.

"I know. That's why I'm not letting him leave this market." Cassian started forward. "Stay close. If this goes wrong, run."

"What are you going to do?"

"Something stupid."

Cassian walked straight up to the emissary and grabbed his arm.

The contact was electric. Through the Coin of Heads, Cassian felt the emptiness inside the man—vast hollows where emotions should be, memories filed away but disconnected from meaning. But there, deeper, fragments remained. A name. A daughter's face. The ghost of what it felt like to care about something.

The emissary jerked back, startled. "Let go—"

"No." Cassian pulled him closer, entering the Silent Market as he did. That grey space between perception and reality snapped into focus. He could see the tether connecting the emissary to Draven's network—a thread of stolen humanity flowing outward to that vast reservoir.

And he could see what would happen if he severed it.

The emissary would collapse, screaming, as everything Draven had stripped away tried to return at once. The accumulated suffering, the guilt, the memories of everyone he'd converted rushing back in a flood that would break his mind. He'd either die or go permanently mad.

Unless Cassian did what he'd done with Torin. Held the connection temporarily. Absorbed the worst of it while the man's mind adjusted.

It would hurt. Badly. And Draven would know immediately.

"You're going to try to free me," the emissary said flatly. Not a question. "Don't. I chose this. I wanted the peace."

"You were manipulated."

"I was *saved*." The emissary's eyes were empty but his voice held conviction. "I had nothing. Was nothing. Draven gave me purpose."

"Draven made you a weapon."

"Yes. And I'm content with that." The emissary tried to pull away, but Cassian's grip tightened. "Let me go, or I'll call the others. There are six more in this market. You can't fight us all."

"I'm not here to fight." Cassian pulled both coins from his pockets. "I'm here to make you an offer."

The emissary's eyes fixed on the medallions. Recognition. Hunger. Fear. "You're the one. The one who freed the hundred. Master warned us you'd try something like this."

"Then you know I can do it. Sever your connection. Give you back what Draven took."

"I don't want it back!" The emissary's voice cracked—the first real emotion Cassian had seen from him. "You think you're saving people? You're damning them! I *remember* what it was like before. The pain. The fear. The grinding, daily horror of watching my daughter starve because I couldn't find work. Draven took that from me. Gave me peace. Purpose. Why would I choose to go back to suffering?"

"Because your daughter is still out there," Cassian said quietly. "And she still needs a father. Not a hollow shell wearing his face."

The emissary went very still.

"I can see her," Cassian said, the Coin of Heads showing him the fragments. "In your memories. Scattered pieces Draven didn't bother to erase because they weren't painful enough to matter. She's eight years old. Brown hair. Crooked front tooth. She makes you laugh when she mispronounces words. You taught her to count using buttons from your coat."

"Stop."

"Her name is Elena. And the last time you saw her—actually saw her, when you were still human—you promised you'd find a way to keep her fed. To keep her safe. Then you signed Draven's contract and traded away your love for her because the pain of failing her was too much to bear."

"I said stop!" The emissary wrenched free, stumbling backward. People were staring now. "You don't know anything about me!"

"I know you're hollow but not empty. I know there's enough of you left to restore." Cassian stepped forward. "I know that if I sever your connection right now, you'll remember everything. Elena's face. The sound of her laugh. What it felt like to love her. And yes, you'll remember the pain too. The fear. The guilt. All of it."

"Then why would I ever agree?"

"Because she's still waiting for you. And you're still her father. Even if you can't feel it anymore."

The emissary's hand moved to the contract ledger at his belt—defensive, habitual. "If you try to restore me, the network will compensate. Someone else will die. Just like before. You'll trade an innocent life for mine."

"Maybe. Probably." Cassian's voice was cold. "But you're not innocent anymore. You've converted dozens of people. Hundreds, maybe. So if the choice is between you staying hollow and converting more, or you dying but taking your corruption with you? I choose your death."

The emissary's eyes widened.

"But I don't think it has to be that way," Cassian continued. "When I freed Torin, one woman died because I didn't understand how the network compensates. I've spent every day since studying the mechanism. And I think—*think*—I can sever you without killing anyone."

"How?"

"By taking the debt myself. Temporarily. Long enough for you to stabilize." Cassian met his eyes. "It'll hurt. Both of us. And I'll be connected to Draven's network for however long it takes. Could be seconds. Could be minutes. But if it works, you'll be free. Whole. Able to remember your daughter and choose what to do about it."

"And if it doesn't work?"

"Then we both die, and Draven has one less enemy and one less recruiter." Cassian's smile was grim. "Those are the terms. Take them or leave them."

The emissary stood frozen, conflict playing across his empty features. Finally: "Why? Why risk your life for someone who's been helping destroy everything you're fighting to protect?"

"Because I'm not fighting to destroy. I'm fighting to restore." Cassian extended his hand. "And because I think there's enough of you left to save. So I'm going to try."

The emissary stared at the offered hand. At the two coins burning hot in Cassian's palm. At Mira standing behind him, ready to run or fight depending on what happened next.

"My daughter," he said quietly. "If I do this—if you restore me—will I be able to find her?"

"Yes."

"And will I still be... myself? Or will I be some broken thing that remembers being human but can't function?"

"I don't know," Cassian admitted. "Torin is functioning but incomplete. It takes time to rebuild what Draven destroyed. But you'll be *you* again. Not hollow. Not Draven's tool. Yourself."

The emissary closed his eyes. When he opened them, something had shifted. A flicker of actual emotion—fear, hope, desperation all mixed together.

"Do it," he said. "Before I lose my nerve."

Cassian grabbed his hand and plunged them both into the Silent Market.

The grey space snapped into sharp focus. Cassian could see the tether connecting the emissary to Draven's network—a pulsing thread of stolen humanity. And beyond it, the vast reservoir where thousands of hollow souls fed their essence.

The tether was thick. Old. This man had been hollow for years.

"Last chance to back out," Cassian said.

"Just do it."

But Cassian didn't sever the tether. Not yet.

Instead, he did something different. Using both coins, he created a bridge between his own mind and the emissary's hollow consciousness. Connected them. Let the man feel what Cassian felt—the weight of caring, the warmth of memory, the complexity of being fully human.

The emissary gasped as sensation flooded back. Not his own memories, but the *experience* of having them. Through Cassian's mind, he could perceive what he'd lost.

"Do you feel that?" Cassian asked quietly. "That's what you traded away. That's what Draven took from you."

"It hurts," the emissary whispered. "Everything hurts—"

"Yes. But look deeper. What else do you feel?"

Through the connection, the emissary could sense his own scattered memories—still there, still his, just disconnected. His daughter's laugh. The pride when she learned to read. The desperate love that had driven him to sign Draven's contract in the first place.

"Elena." The word came out broken. "I remember—she's real. She's *real* and I abandoned her—"

"She's waiting for you," Cassian said. "Still alive. Still hoping you'll come back. But you can't reach her while you're hollow. While Draven holds what you traded away."

The emissary could see it now through Cassian's perception—the tether connecting him to the network, feeding his humanity into Draven's reservoir. His love for his daughter, his grief, his shame, his hope—all of it flowing away, keeping him empty.

"I was deceived," the emissary said, horror dawning in his voice. "He said—Draven said I'd have peace. That I wouldn't suffer anymore. But this isn't peace. It's *nothing*. I feel nothing. I *am* nothing."

"You can get it back," Cassian said. "But first, you need to understand something. Show me your contract. The one you signed with Draven."

Through their connection, the emissary's memory of the contract surfaced—black ink on yellowed paper, elegant script promising relief from suffering in exchange for "service of equivalent value" and "compensation deemed appropriate by the benefactor."

Cassian studied it carefully, his ledger-keeper's mind analyzing every clause. Then he smiled grimly. "Do you see it? The terms are deliberately vague. 'Service of equivalent value'—but Draven never specified what service or for how long. 'Compensation deemed appropriate'—but he never defined what was appropriate or who would judge it."

"I don't understand—"

"The contract is open-ended. Exploitable. That's how Draven tricked you—the vagueness made it seem reasonable when you signed, but he interpreted it to mean *everything you are* in exchange for *nothing real*. He used the ambiguity to steal far more than you expected." Cassian's voice grew intense. "But here's the thing about vague contracts: they cut both ways. If the terms aren't precisely defined, then they're open to interpretation. And *you* can interpret them too."

The emissary's hollow eyes widened slightly. "I can... back out?"

Cassian nodded. "You can nullify it. The contract says 'service of equivalent value'—but what you've given is worth far more than what you received. What did you actually receive from Draven? Nothing. That's not equivalent." Cassian showed him through their connection. "You can declare the contract fulfilled. You can say you've already given more than enough service for the peace you were promised—which was none at all. And because the terms are vague, because Draven deliberately left them open to interpretation, you can back out. If you choose. If you decide to reclaim what's yours."

"But—what if Draven doesn't agree...to release me?"

"He doesn't have to. He made it vague as a trap—and most people become too hollow to find it the loophole." Cassian's grip tightened on the emissary's awareness. "Right now, I've given you back your sanity. Your clarity of mind. Right now, you can see the door and choose to walk through it. But you have to choose. You have to want your humanity back more than you want the emptiness."

Through the connection, the emissary could feel the weight of what he'd lost. Elena's laugh. The pride of being her father. The pain, yes—but also the joy, the love, the *mattering* of it all. Everything that made life worth living, even when it hurt.

"The contract is fulfilled," the emissary said, his voice gaining strength. "I've given enough. More than enough. For nothing worth having." His awareness grasped at his scattered pieces—memories, emotions, the capacity to care. "I'm taking back what's mine. By the terms of this contract, which were never clearly defined, I declare my service complete. I reclaim my payment. I refuse the emptiness."

The Law listened.

It evaluated the contract—the vague terms, the unbalanced exchange, the debtor's claim that service had been rendered and found wanting.

And the Law accepted.

Just as Draven had used the vague contract to take more than he'd promised, the emissary used it to take back what was his.

The tether shattered.

Everything that had been drained away rushed back in a flood—memories, emotions, connections, the full weight of being human. The emissary screamed as it hit him all at once. Years of accumulated experience crashing back into his awareness.

Cassian held the connection steady, bearing some of the weight, preventing it from destroying the man's mind. The Coin of Heads gave him the mental fortitude to withstand it—to carry the burden until the emissary could adjust, could integrate, could remember how to hold his own wholeness.

Through the network, Cassian felt Draven's awareness snap toward them—surprise, then cold understanding. The loophole. Cassian had found the loophole.

But by then it was too late. The transaction was complete. The Law had sided with the emissary, and not even Draven could undo what the Law had accepted.

Carefully, Cassian withdrew.

The emissary collapsed to his knees in the real world, gasping. But his eyes—his eyes were clear. Filled with tears, yes. Filled with pain and joy and guilt and hope all mixed together. But *filled*. Human.

"Elena," he whispered. Then louder, desperate: "Elena!"

Cassian staggered, exhausted but intact. The weight of holding that connection had been immense—like carrying another person's entire existence for those crucial moments. But he hadn't lost anything permanent. Just energy. Mental strength that would recover with rest.

Mira rushed forward, helping Cassian stand. "Are you all right?"

"Tired." Cassian's voice was hoarse. "Very tired. But I'm whole. And so is he."

The emissary sat up, tears streaming down his face. "Elena. I have to—I have to find her. Is she still—?"

"She's alive," Cassian said. "In the refugee quarter. I saw her in your memories. She's been surviving by begging near the south market."

The emissary covered his face, sobbing. "I abandoned her. For *peace*. What kind of father—"

"The kind who was deceived," Cassian said firmly. "Draven promised you peace. He gave you emptiness. That wasn't a fair trade. That's why you were able to reclaim what was yours."

The emissary looked up, eyes red but focused. "Will it last? Or will I slip back into—"

"You chose to take back your humanity. You saw what you'd lost and demanded it back. That choice can't be undone unless you willingly sign another contract with Draven. And knowing what you know now..." Cassian met his eyes. "Would you ever make that trade again?"

"Never." The word was fierce, absolute. "I'd die first. I'd let Elena watch me starve before I became that hollow thing again."

"Then you're safe from him. The deception only works once."

The emissary looked up, eyes red but focused. "What do you need me to do?"

"Find your daughter. Keep her safe. And if you see other emissaries approaching desperate people—warn them. Tell them what really happens when you sign. Use the fact that you've been on the inside."

"Draven will kill me when he realizes what happened."

"He will probably try. Which is why you need to disappear. Change your name. Leave the city if you can." Cassian pressed a small pouch of coins into his hand. "This should get you far enough away. Start over. Be a father again."

The emissary stared at the coins. "You're not keeping me here? Using me as a weapon?"

"No. I'm giving you back your life. What you do with it is your choice." Cassian met his eyes. "Though if you want to help fight Draven, I won't stop you. Just know that it'll cost you. Maybe everything."

The man nodded slowly. Then: "What's your name? I should know the name of the man who saved me."

"Cassian."

"Thank you, Cassian." The emissary stood on shaky legs. "I was—my name is Perin. Before I was hollow, I was Perin Casto. Carpenter. Father. I'd forgotten." He looked at his hands like they were foreign objects. "I'd forgotten I had a name that wasn't 'emissary.'"

"You're Perin again. Remember that."

Perin nodded and stumbled away into the crowd, heading south toward where his daughter waited.

Cassian watched him go, feeling the weight of what he'd just done. One emissary restored. Dozens of future conversions prevented. But also—one man who'd remember every life he'd ruined while hollow. Who'd carry that guilt forever.

Was that mercy? Or just a different kind of cruelty?

"That was incredible," Mira breathed. "You actually did it."

"Once." Cassian wiped sweat from his brow. "I did it once. And it took everything I had just to hold that connection. The question is whether I can do it again after I've rested. And again. Eight more times just in this city."

"Can you?"

"The method works. But bearing that weight... it's exhausting. Like carrying another person on my shoulders for however long it takes them to reclaim their pieces. I'll need rest after doing that. Time to recover my mental strength."

"How long?"

"A day, maybe two. My first coin gives me mental fortitude. And..." He paused. "I can think more clearly than ever before. But I still have limits." Cassian straightened, forcing strength back into his voice. "I just need to recover my energy."

"And when Draven realizes what you're doing?"

"He already knows. I touched his network. He felt it." Cassian's smile was grim. "Which means he'll either fortify his emissaries against restoration, or he'll come for me directly. Either way, I need to move fast. Restore as many as I can before he adapts."

Mira was quiet for a moment. Then: "I want to learn how to do it. Restore people. Not just recognize desperation, but actually reverse what Draven's done."

"It requires the coins."

"Then teach me to use them. Or find me some other way." Her voice was fierce. "You can't do this alone. You said it yourself—you need people working in parallel. If you're restoring emissaries in Arvenstead, I could be doing the same in Rothaven. Or the Eastern Reaches."

Cassian studied her face. The determination. The desperate need to help her brother by helping others. "You're not ready."

"Then make me ready."

"It takes time—"

"We don't have time!" Mira's voice cracked. "How many people are signing contracts right now while we stand here talking? How many more will sign tomorrow? Next week? You can't save them all. You said it yourself. But maybe together we can save enough to matter."

Cassian wanted to argue. To point out all the ways she wasn't prepared, how the work would destroy her, how she'd already proven she couldn't be trusted. But he looked at her and saw something familiar—the same desperate determination he'd felt when he touched his father's coin for the first time. The need to *do something*, even if it meant sacrificing pieces of yourself.

"All right," he said finally. "I'll teach you. But we start small. Observing. Learning. You don't try to restore anyone until I'm certain you won't accidentally kill them."

"How long will that take?"

"Months. Maybe longer."

"That's too long—"

"That's how long it takes." Cassian's voice was firm. "I won't let you hurt people because you're impatient. This work requires precision. Understanding. Rush it, and you'll do more harm than Draven's emissaries."

Mira deflated slightly. "Fine. Months. But we start today."

"We start now." Cassian gestured to the market. "There are at least two more emissaries working this district. We're going to watch them. Learn their patterns. And when I've recovered enough to try again, we'll restore another one."

"And then?"

"And then we do it again. And again. Until either Draven stops us or we've restored every single one of his recruiters." Cassian's smile was cold. "He wants to play with arithmetic? Fine. Let's see how his numbers work when I'm subtracting his soldiers instead of just defending against them."

---

That night, Cassian sat with Torin in the healing ward, exhausted but wired.

"You look terrible," Torin observed.

"I restored a hollow emissary today. Took his debt into myself temporarily. It was... unpleasant."

"Did it work?"

"Yes. He's human again. Went to find his daughter."

"Good." Torin paused. "Will you do that to me? Take whatever's missing and put it back?"

"I'm trying. But your situation is different. You were severed from the network early. There's no tether to cut anymore. What you need isn't restoration—it's cultivation. Growing new connections from what's left."

"That sounds slow."

"It is."

"I don't want to be slow." Torin's voice held the first hint of frustration Cassian had heard. "I want to be fixed. *Now*."

"I know. But that's not how this works."

"Why not? You have two coins. You can do things no one else can. Why can't you just... make me whole again?"

"Because that's not how it works," Cassian said. "I can't give you my memories—they wouldn't be yours. What I can do is connect my mind to yours. Show you what wholeness looks like. Give you a pattern to follow." He met Torin's eyes. "But the actual work of rebuilding? That's yours. I can carry the burden temporarily, show you the direction, but you have to walk the path."

Torin was quiet for a long moment. "That's not fair. You shouldn't have to choose between helping me and helping others."

"No. It's not fair. But it's the arithmetic I have to work with."

"The arithmetic." Torin's voice held a hint of something—maybe frustration, maybe respect. "You were a ledger-keeper. You must be good at arithmetic."

Despite everything, Cassian smiled. "I was. Still am, in a way. The numbers are just bigger now. More complicated."

They sat in silence for a while. Then Torin said: "The emissary you restored. Perin. Will he stay human?"

"I don't know. The restoration worked, but I don't know if it'll last. Could be permanent. Could fade. I won't know until I check on him in a few days."

"And if it fades?"

"Then I've learned something. And I'll try differently next time." Cassian stood, wincing at the ache in his chest. "That's all any of us can do. Try. Fail. Learn. Try again."

"That also sounds slow."

"It is. But it's the only way forward." Cassian started toward the door, then paused. "Torin? Earlier today, when I planted that memory in your mind—the feeling of someone caring for you—did it feel real? Or did it feel foreign? Like it wasn't yours?"

Torin considered. "It felt... borrowed. Like wearing someone else's coat. It fit, but it wasn't *mine*."

"Good. That's what I needed to know." Cassian filed that information away. The planted memories worked but felt artificial. Which meant true restoration required growing new connections from native material, not just grafting foreign pieces. "Get some rest. Tomorrow we'll try again."

"Will we make progress?"

"Probably. A little. Enough to keep trying."

After Cassian left, Torin sat alone in the dark ward, holding the cup of cold tea.

He brought it to his nose and inhaled, trying to recapture that brief feeling from earlier. The sense of safety. Of someone nearby who cared.

Nothing.

But he remembered that it had happened. That for a brief moment, he'd felt something more than empty observation.

And if it had happened once, it could happen again.

So tomorrow, he'd try again.

It was slow. It was frustrating. But it was better than accepting permanent emptiness.

Torin took a sip of the cold tea, searching for meaning in the taste.

Still nothing.

But he'd keep trying.

Because somewhere deep in his fragmented mind, something remembered what it felt like to hope.

And that was enough to keep him drinking tea every morning with a stranger who'd traded pieces of himself to plant seeds in ash.

Hoping they'd grow into something worth being.

Miles away, in a tent on the edge of Hollow territory, Draven Kane looked at his golden locket and watched the network pulse with activity.

"Perin Casto," he murmured to the imprisoned coin inside. "Restored. Interesting."

One of his lieutenants—a woman who'd been hollow for seven years—stood nearby. "Should we retrieve him? Kill him? Make an example?"

"No. Let him run. Let him think he's won." Draven's eyes gleamed as he studied the network's structure. "Cassian's method is clever. He connects his mind to theirs. Uses his mental fortitude to show them what they've lost. Then convinces them to uses my own contract against me."

The lieutenant's voice was flat. "He found a loophole."

"He did." Draven's smile didn't waver. "The vagueness cuts both ways."

"Then we change the contracts. Make them iron-clad. Specific—"

"No." Draven's voice was sharp. "People won't sign if they see the true cost written plainly. The vagueness is necessary—it's what makes desperate people willing to sign in the first place." He leaned back, considering. "To have enough clarity to revoke the contract, Cassian has to connect to them first. Has to restore their mind while they reclaim their pieces."

"So we make the weight unbearable."

"Exactly." Draven's smile returned. "Let him restore the weak ones. Let him perfect his technique. Let him grow confident that his method works. Overconfident" He traced a finger across the map. "But while he's doing that, I'm preparing someone whose weight will crush him."

The lieutenant tilted her head. "Something stronger?"

"Someone stronger. An emissary so deeply embedded in my network, with so much debt, so much accumulated weight, that when Cassian tries to connect..." Draven's eyes gleamed. "He'll bear a burden that will break him. Not kill him—that would be wasteful. But break his mind. Leave him hollow himself. Or close enough to it that he'll finally understand what I'm offering isn't corruption—it's mercy."

"How long?"

"A few weeks. Let him restore five, maybe six more emissaries. He will develop a routine, a system, a belief that he's found the answer. In fact..." Draven pulled out a ledger, flipping to a specific page. "I'll make those emissaries even weaker. I'll make it easier each time for him to release them. Then..." Draven's smile grew even more cruel. "Introduce him to Marcus Thel. The man who converted three thousand soldiers personally. He carries the weight of every life he ruined. He's been hollow for a decade—the bonds are so deep, so integrated, that even I can barely tell where the man ends and the network begins."

"And when Cassian tries to connect to him?"

"He'll feel the weight of three thousand stolen souls. All that guilt. All that suffering. All that accumulated debt flooding into his mind at once." Draven's smile was cold. "His mental fortitude is strong—the Coin of Heads grants him that. But he has his limits. And I'm going to find them."

The lieutenant nodded slowly. "And if he somehow survives it?"

"Then I'll have learned even more about how he works. How much he can carry. What breaks him." Draven returned to his maps. "Either way, I win. He restores my weak emissaries—expendable losses. Or he tries to restore Marcus and destroys himself. Or he realizes the trap and stops trying to restore anyone, which means I keep my recruiting network intact."

"The Law favors you."

"The Law always favors me." Draven touched the locket almost lovingly. "Because I'm patient. I think in decades, not days. Cassian is brilliant—possibly the most dangerous opponent I've faced. But he's also desperate. Urgent. He wants to save everyone right now. That urgency makes him predictable. Exploitable."

He pulled out a quill and wrote a series of names on a fresh parchment. "Position these emissaries in Arvenstead. Make sure they're visible. Make sure they seem vulnerable. Let Cassian restore them. Each one teaches him nothing new but costs him energy. Wears him down. Makes him tired."

"And when he's tired?"

"Then introduce him to Marcus. When he's exhausted. When his guard is down. When he's convinced himself that restoration is just a matter of effort and will." Draven's smile was terrible to see. "And watch him break."

The lieutenant took the list and bowed. "It will be done."

After she left, Draven sat alone in the tent, studying the network's pulse. He could feel Cassian's presence now—a bright point of resistance where the young Champion had touched his reservoir during Perin's restoration. Not weakened, exactly. But present. Connected, if only for a moment.

"You're good at this," Draven murmured to the absent enemy. "Better than your father. More strategic. More willing to adapt." He smiled. "But you're still thinking like a hero. Still believing that enough effort can save everyone. And that belief—that beautiful, tragic optimism—will be your undoing."

In the distance, thunder rumbled. Rain began to fall on the tent—cold, steady, relentless.

Draven listened to it and planned.

Cassian would restore the weak and grow confident. He'd believe he'd found the path forward.

And then Draven would show him that some weights couldn't be carried.

Some debts couldn't be shared.

Some people were too hollow to save.

And when Cassian learned that lesson—when he felt his mind breaking under too much accumulated guilt—he would finally understand what Draven had known for decades.

Emptiness wasn't the enemy.

It was the only shelter in a world where caring meant suffering without end.

The storm intensified outside, but Draven sat warm and dry in his tent, planning victory through patience.

He could wait.

He always could.
