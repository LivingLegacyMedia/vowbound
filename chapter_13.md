# Chapter 13: Seeds in Ash

The emissary stood near the fountain in the east market, watching the crowd with practiced patience. To anyone else, he looked like a kind middle-aged man taking in the morning air. But Cassian had been studying him for three days, and he knew better.

The man was hunting.

"There," Mira whispered beside him. "The woman with the crying baby."

Cassian nodded, already tracking her through the Coin of Heads. The young mother was at her breaking point—exhaustion written in every line of her body, desperation leaking from her like a scent the emissary could smell. The baby wouldn't stop screaming. The older child pulled at her skirts, demanding food. People were staring.

She looked ready to collapse.

The emissary moved with perfect, practiced timing.

He approached with a sympathetic smile, speaking words too quiet for Cassian to hear. But he could see the mother's expression shift from exhaustion to desperate hope. The emissary was offering something. Relief. Peace. Just sign here.

"We have to stop him," Mira started forward.

Cassian grabbed her arm. "Wait."

"But—"

"Watch."

The mother reached for the contract ledger, hand trembling. The emissary's smile widened. Then—at the last moment—she pulled back. Shook her head. Gathered her children and walked away quickly, as if afraid she'd change her mind.

The emissary's smile didn't waver. He simply turned, scanning the crowd for his next target.

"He'll just find someone else," Mira said.

"Not if I stop him first." Cassian started forward. "Stay close. If this goes wrong, run."

"What are you going to do?"

"Something I've been thinking about for days." Cassian's hand closed around the Coin of Heads in his pocket. "Something dangerous."

---

The idea had come to Cassian three nights ago, after another failed session with Torin in the healing ward.

He'd been studying the young man's fragmented mind through the Coin of Heads—seeing all those disconnected pieces floating like debris after a shipwreck. Memories without meaning. Sensations without connection. Everything there but nothing linked together.

The Coin of Heads had shown him something he'd missed before. When he looked at Torin's mind, then looked at his own, the difference wasn't in the *pieces* but in the *pattern*. Cassian's thoughts connected naturally—memory to emotion, sensation to meaning, cause to effect. Torin's didn't.

But what if that pattern could be *shown*? Not imposed, but demonstrated?

What if Cassian could let Torin borrow his mind's structure—just for a moment—long enough to see what wholeness looked like?

He'd spent two days considering the risks. The Coin of Heads granted him authority over the realm of mind—that much was becoming clearer with each use. It let him see mental structures, perceive thoughts, understand how consciousness worked. But could it let him *share* that structure?

Could he build a bridge?

The danger was obvious. Connecting his mind to Torin's fragmented consciousness could destabilize both of them. Cassian's wholeness might drain into Torin's emptiness like water seeking level. Or worse—Torin's brokenness might infect Cassian's intact pathways, fragmenting him too.

But Cassian's mind had grown stronger these past weeks. Every time he used the Coin of Heads, every mental exercise, every problem he solved—all of it had been building his mental fortitude. Not through trades or tricks, but through practice. Like strengthening a muscle.

If his mind was strong enough, he might be able to withstand the contact.

Might.

He'd tried it once, this morning. Very carefully. Very briefly.

It had worked.

For just a moment, Torin had felt what it was like to have his thoughts connected. The tea made him feel comfortable, safe. Feeling comfortable made him feel cared for, being cared for linking to his mother's memory. Everything flowing together naturally, the way it should.

Then Cassian had withdrawn, and Torin had slumped forward, gasping—but with something approaching *wonder* in his empty eyes.

"That was..." Torin had whispered. "I *felt* something."

Now, watching the emissary hunt for victims in the marketplace, Cassian wondered: if the technique worked on Torin, could it work on someone who was hollow?

Could he show an emissary what they'd lost?

There was only one way to find out.

---

Cassian walked straight up to the emissary and grabbed his arm.

The man jerked back, startled. "What—"

"I know what you are." Cassian's voice was low, urgent. "And I know what you used to be."

The emissary's eyes narrowed. Around them, the market crowd flowed past, oblivious. "Let go of me."

"Your name is Perin. You were a carpenter. You had a daughter—Elena. Eight years old, brown hair, crooked front tooth." Cassian tightened his grip as the emissary tried to pull away. "You loved her so much it hurt. Then you couldn't feed her. Couldn't keep her safe. So you signed a contract with Draven Kane, and he took that love away. Made you empty so you wouldn't feel the pain of failing her."

The emissary went very still. "How do you—"

"I can see it. Your memories. Scattered but still there." Cassian pulled out the Coin of Heads. "And I can show you. Make you remember what you traded away. Would you let me try?"

"No." The word was flat, reflexive. "I don't want to remember."

"Your daughter is still out there. Still waiting for you."

"I don't *have* a daughter anymore. I'm—" The emissary's voice cracked slightly. "I'm nothing. Empty. That's the peace I bought."

"That's the lie Draven sold you." Cassian could see the hollow shimmer around the man through the coin—smooth, reflective, but with cracks. Fragments of personality left intact so you would seem more human to your victims. "Your master left enough of you behind to be useful. That means you have some humanity left in you."

Around them, people were starting to stare. The emissary glanced nervously at the crowd. "If I call out, six more emissaries will be here in minutes. You can't fight us all."

"I'm not here to fight." Cassian met his eyes. "I'm here to make you an offer. Let me show you what you lost. Just for a moment. If you still want the emptiness after that, I'll walk away."

"And if I refuse?"

"Then I'll follow you. Stop you from recruiting. Warn every desperate person you approach." Cassian's voice was hard. "You'll be useless to Draven. And you know what he does with useless tools."

The emissary's jaw tightened. Fear flickered across his hollow features—not for himself, but fear of losing his purpose, his only remaining anchor. "You're cruel."

"Yes. But not as cruel as leaving you hollow while your daughter begs for bread in the refugee quarter."

The emissary flinched. That image still hurt him—not the way it should, not with a father's love, but like a distant ache. Proof that fragments remained.

"One moment," Cassian said quietly. "Let me show you what you lost. Then the choice is yours."

The emissary looked at the coin, then at Cassian's face, then at the crowd flowing past. Desperate people everywhere. People he'd recruited. People he'd helped hollow.

"One moment," he agreed finally. "Then you leave me alone."

Cassian nodded. Then, very carefully, he entered his gray space.

From here, he could see the emissary's consciousness more clearly. Not shattered like Torin's, but *hollowed*—carved out deliberately, systematically. The structure remained, but the contents had been drained away through a tether connecting him to Draven's network. A pulsing thread of stolen humanity, feeding his essence into that vast reservoir.

And scattered in the hollow spaces, fragments. Memories Draven hadn't bothered to erase because they weren't painful enough to matter. A daughter's laugh. The smell of fresh-cut wood. The pride of building something with his own hands.

Cassian reached out with the Coin of Heads, creating a bridge between his mind and the emissary's hollow consciousness. He connected them carefully, letting the man feel what Cassian felt—the weight of caring, the warmth of memory, the complexity of being fully human.

The emissary gasped as sensation flooded back. Not his own memories yet, but the *experience* of having them. Through Cassian's mind, he could perceive what he'd lost.

"Do you feel that?" Cassian asked quietly in the grey space. "That's what you traded away. That's what Draven took from you."

"It hurts," the emissary whispered. "Everything hurts—"

"Yes. But look deeper. What else do you feel?"

Through the connection, the emissary could sense his own scattered memories—still there, still his, just disconnected from the tether. His daughter's laugh. The pride when she learned her letters. The desperate love that had driven him to sign Draven's contract in the first place.

"Elena." The word came out broken. "I remember—she's real. She's *real* and I abandoned her—"

"She's waiting for you," Cassian said. "Still alive. Still hoping you'll come back. But you can't reach her while you're hollow. While Draven holds what you traded away."

The emissary could see it now through Cassian's perception—the tether connecting him to the network, feeding his humanity into Draven's reservoir. His love for his daughter, his grief, his shame, his hope—all of it flowing away, keeping him empty.

"I was deceived," the emissary said, horror dawning in his voice. "He said—Draven said I'd have peace. That I wouldn't suffer anymore. But this isn't peace. It's *nothing*. I feel nothing. I *am* nothing."

"You can take it back," Cassian said. "But first, I need to explain something about the contract you signed."

Through their connection, Cassian showed the emissary his own memory of that day—the contract Draven offered, black ink on yellowed paper, elegant script promising relief from suffering in exchange for "service of equivalent value" and "compensation deemed appropriate by the benefactor."

The emissary stared at the memory. "I remember signing it. I remember thinking it was fair."

"Look at the terms again. Really look." Cassian guided his attention to the specific phrases. "'Service of equivalent value'—did Draven ever tell you what that service would be? How long it would last?"

"No. He just said... I'd serve. Until the debt was paid."

"And 'compensation deemed appropriate by the benefactor'—did he tell you what he considered appropriate?"

The emissary's hollow eyes narrowed. "He said... peace. Relief from grief."

"Peace." Cassian let the word hang between them. "And what did you actually get?"

"Nothing. I feel... nothing."

"Exactly. Not peace. Emptiness. Those aren't the same thing." Cassian's voice grew intense. "You signed a contract promising peace in exchange for service. But he gave you emptiness—which is worthless—and he's made you serve for *years*. You've been recruiting people, converting hundreds of souls to his network. That's not 'service of equivalent value.' That's slavery."

Through the connection, the emissary could see it now. The contract's vagueness. The way Draven had interpreted every ambiguous phrase to his own advantage. The massive imbalance between what was promised and what was delivered.

"I was cheated," the emissary whispered.

"Yes. And because the terms were never clearly defined, you have the right to challenge them. To demand fair compensation." Cassian pulled out a second object—another coin, different from the first. Warmer. "As an emissary, you know how the Law of Balance works, right? Every trade must be fair. Equal value exchanged."

"Yes. That's what we tell people when they sign."

"Then you understand: if you've given far more than you received, you're owed the difference. It's basic accounting." Cassian's ledger-keeper instincts came through clearly. "You agreed to temporary service for peace. Instead, you've given years of work for nothing. The Law itself will recognize that imbalance—if you petition correctly."

"Petition? How?"

"Here's what's going to happen." Cassian spoke slowly, making sure the emissary understood. "I'm going to make an offer to the Law—to take your place temporarily. You know the connection you feel? The one binding you to Draven's network?"

"The... yes. The pull. Like something's always draining me."

"That's your tether. What Draven uses to keep you hollow." Cassian met his eyes. "I'm going to take that connection onto myself. Just for a short time. That means *I'll* feel the emptiness instead of you. It'll hurt me, but it'll free you. For just a few minutes, you won't be bound to him anymore."

The emissary's breath quickened. "And then?"

"Then you make your own offer to the Law. While you're free, you say: 'I've served for years beyond what my contract required. I've recruited hundreds of people. That service is worth far more than temporary peace—which I never received anyway. I demand compensation. I want my humanity returned.'"

"My... humanity?"

"Everything Draven took from you." Cassian showed him through their connection—the love for Elena, the pride in his work, the capacity to care. "It's not gone. It's being held somewhere. Stored. And if you've overpaid your contract—which you absolutely have—the Law *has* to give it back to you. That's how balance works."

The emissary was quiet for a long moment. Through the connection, Cassian could feel him weighing the choice. The safety of emptiness versus the pain of being human again. The certainty of nothing versus the risk of everything.

Finally: "What do I need to do?"

"When I take your burden, you'll feel the connection release. You'll have a few minutes—maybe less—where you're completely free. Use that time to speak to the Law. Out loud or in your mind, doesn't matter. Tell it you've overpaid. Tell it you demand your humanity back as compensation. Be specific: your love for your daughter, your memories, your ability to feel. Everything Draven took. Understood?"

"Understood."

"The Law will evaluate your claim. If it agrees you've overpaid—and you absolutely have—it'll grant your petition. Your humanity will return." Cassian gripped both coins tightly. "When that happens, don't fight it. Let it in. Let yourself feel again, even though it hurts. Trust me. Can you do that?"

The emissary looked at his hands—hollow, empty, capable of terrible things in Draven's service. Then he looked at Cassian's face, seeing genuine conviction there.

"Yes," he said. "I trust you."

"Then we start now." Cassian closed his eyes, entering the gray space fully. "Remember: when you feel the connection release, petition immediately. You won't have much time before I have to let go."

The emissary nodded, preparing himself.

Cassian reached out to the Law itself, speaking clearly: "I offer to take this man's burden temporarily. His connection to Draven's network—I'll hold it in his place. In exchange, release him from that binding. Just for a few minutes. Let him be free to speak on his own behalf."

The Law considered. It was a fair offer. A burden for a burden, temporary but genuine.

It accepted.

The tether shifted from the emissary to Cassian.

Emptiness flooded in like ice water. Cassian felt the connection to Draven's network wrap around his essence, binding him to that vast reservoir. Felt the pull trying to drain him, to make him hollow. His emotions began to flatten. His thoughts began to scatter.

*Hold on,* he told himself desperately. *Just hold on.*

In the real world, the emissary gasped. For the first time in years, he felt the tether release. The constant draining stopped. He was free.

"Now!" Cassian managed through gritted teeth. "Petition now!"

The emissary didn't need to enter any gray space—Cassian was doing that for him. He just needed to speak. To make his case to the Law that governed all exchanges.

"I signed a contract," the emissary said, his voice gaining strength as he spoke. "Draven Kane promised me peace in exchange for service of equivalent value. But I got nothing—no peace, just emptiness. And I've given him *years*. I've recruited hundreds of people. I've served his network. That wasn't in my contract. That's not equivalent service—I've overpaid."

The Law listened.

"I demand what's owed to me," the emissary continued. "I've paid far more than my contract required. I want compensation. I want my humanity back—everything that was taken. My love for my daughter. My memories. My ability to feel. Everything Draven holds that's mine. That's fair. That's balanced. I've earned it."

In the gray space, Cassian felt the Law evaluating the claim. Checking the contract's vague language. Weighing years of service as an emissary against the promised "relief from suffering" that had never truly been delivered.

The balance was not even close.

The emissary had overpaid.

Drastically.

The Law ruled in his favor.

From Draven's reservoir, everything that had been drained away—the emissary's love, his grief, his memories, his capacity to care—came rushing back like a dam breaking. But Cassian was ready. Even as the hollowness tried to overwhelm him, he channeled the returning humanity through his second coin.

Cassian could barely hold it—maintaining the tether with one coin while the other facilitated restoration, all while the network tried to hollow him out. His vision grayed. His thoughts began to blur. For a terrifying moment, he felt himself fragmenting, becoming nothing—

Then he released the tether.

The connection snapped back toward Perin, but found nowhere to attach. Perin was whole now, his humanity restored and growing. The tether couldn't reconnect to someone who was complete. It scattered into fragments, dissipating into the gray space.

Gone.

Cassian collapsed back into his own mind, gasping. Both coins burned in his palms—the Coin of Heads keeping his thoughts coherent despite the exhaustion, the Coin of Seeds still humming with residual growth energy.

Through the network, Cassian felt Draven's awareness snap toward them—surprise, then cold understanding. But by then it was too late. Both trades were complete. The Law had sided with Perin.

Cassian waited, bracing himself. Last time—when he'd freed Torin—he'd only had one coin. He'd taken Torin's place temporarily, given him a window of freedom, but had no way to restore what had already been drained away. Torin had been able to break the tether through resistance, but the damage was already done. Weeks of being hollow had depleted his humanity, and Cassian had no way to return it.

But this time was different. This time, Cassian had both coins. The Coin of Heads to hold the tether away from the hollow's mind. The Coin of Seeds to broker a trade for restoration. And Perin himself had been hollow long enough to have *overpaid* his contract substantially—giving him the legal argument to demand a full refund.

Two trades. Two coins. Both necessary.

And the trades were elegant. Balanced. Fair.

The Law couldn't deny them.

Cassian sensed no death in the network. No compensation required elsewhere. Just Perin, gasping and whole, and Cassian exhausted but intact.

The difference was simple: Torin's contract was still technically active when Cassian freed him. The Law had no grounds to return what Draven had taken because the agreement was still in force. Perin's contract, however, had been fulfilled beyond its terms. The Law *had* to return what was owed.

One method scattered the tether through resistance. The other nullified the contract through legal argument.

Both freed the person. But only one restored them completely.

No time to wonder. Carefully, painfully, Cassian withdrew.

They both collapsed in the real world.

Cassian hit the cobblestones hard, gasping. His chest felt like it was being crushed. Every breath was agony. Mira was at his side instantly, hands on her shoulders.

"Cassian! Are you—"

"I'm fine," he managed. "Just... exhausted. Help him."

Perin was on his knees nearby, tears streaming down his face. But his eyes—his eyes were clear. Filled with pain and joy and guilt and hope all mixed together. But *filled*. Human.

"Elena," he whispered. Then louder, desperate: "Elena! Where is she? I have to—I have to find her—"

"South market," Cassian said, still struggling to breathe. "Refugee quarter. I saw her in your memories. She's been surviving by begging."

Perin covered his face, sobbing. "I abandoned her. For *peace*. What kind of father—"

"The kind who was deceived." Cassian forced himself to sit up, ignoring the way his vision swam. "Draven promised you peace. He gave you emptiness. That wasn't a fair trade. That's why you were able to reclaim what was yours."

Perin looked up, eyes red but focused. "Will it last? Or will I slip back into—"

"You chose to take back your humanity. That choice can't be undone unless you willingly sign another contract with Draven. And knowing what you know now..." Cassian met his eyes. "Would you ever make that trade again?"

"Never." The word was fierce, absolute. "I'd die first. I'd let Elena watch me starve before I became that hollow thing again."

"Then you're free of him." Cassian pressed a small pouch of coins into his hand. "Take this. Get your daughter. Leave the city if you can. Draven will come for you when he realizes what happened."

Perin stared at the coins. "You're not keeping me here? Using me as a weapon?"

"No. I'm giving you back your life. What you do with it is your choice." Cassian met his eyes. "Though if you want to help fight Draven, I won't stop you. Just know that it'll cost you. Maybe everything."

Perin nodded slowly. "What's your name? I should know the name of the man who saved me."

"Cassian."

"Thank you, Cassian." Perin stood on shaky legs. "I was—my name is Perin. Carpenter. Father. I'd forgotten." He looked at his hands like they were foreign objects. "I'd forgotten I had a name that wasn't 'emissary.'"

Cassian lifted his hand and placed it on the man's shoulder. "You're Perin again. Remember that."

Perin nodded and stumbled away into the crowd, heading south toward where his daughter waited.

Cassian watched him go, then closed his eyes, reaching out with his senses. Trying to feel if the network had compensated. If someone had died.

He couldn't tell. When he'd freed Torin, he'd felt the weight of a life winking out. The woman dragged in by the guards, nose bleeding, confirmed this. But had that been real? Or had Draven made it seem real, planting the sensation to discourage future restorations?

Now, with Perin freed, Cassian felt... nothing. Just exhaustion. Just the weight of what he'd carried.

The uncertainty gnawed at him.

"That was incredible," Mira breathed, watching Perin depart. "You actually did it."

"Once." Cassian wiped sweat from his brow. "I did it once. And it took everything I had in me."

They sat in silence for a moment. Then Mira asked: "Can you do it again?"

Cassian tested his mental strength, feeling the exhaustion settling into his bones. "Yes. But not today. Maybe not tomorrow. Bearing that weight... it took everything I had." He looked at the crowd flowing past. "But the method works. And every day I delay, more people sign contracts they don't understand."

"So you'll rest, then try again."

"Yes." Cassian forced himself to stand, swaying slightly. "And again. Until either Draven stops me or I've restored every single one of his recruiters."

Mira helped steady him. "You look terrible."

"I feel worse." Cassian managed a grim smile. "But I'll recover. I just need—"

His vision grayed at the edges. The world tilted.

Mira caught him before he hit the ground.

---

Cassian woke in the healing ward with Torin staring at him.

"You overextended yourself," the young man observed. "Your body couldn't sustain the mental exertion."

"Thanks for the diagnosis." Cassian's voice was hoarse. He tried to sit up and immediately regretted it. "How long was I out?"

"Six hours. My sister brought you in. She said you collapsed after restoring an emissary." Torin's voice was flat, but there was something like concern underneath it. Or maybe Cassian was imagining it. "Did it work?"

"She said you made the man better."

Cassian blinked, still trying to wake his weary body. But he was glad to hear the good news.

"Good." He said. "The first of many."

"You can free more of them?" Torin inquired.

"Once I've recovered, yes."

"How long will that take?"

"A day. Maybe two. My mind needs time to... recharge. Get its strength back." Cassian looked at Torin. "In the meantime, I should probably continue your restoration. Get you back to functional while I'm resting."

"I'd appreciate that." Torin handed him a cup of tea. "I've been practicing what you showed me. Trying to connect the tea smell to being safe at home. It's... difficult. Like trying to remember a language I used to speak fluently but forgot."

"That's a good analogy." Cassian took the cup, sipping carefully. "Your mind is relearning how to make connections. It'll get easier with practice."

"How much practice?"

"We don't know." Cassian set down the cup. "There's no shortcut for this kind of healing. No trade that'll just fix you instantly. Just slow, patient work."

Torin nodded slowly. "Then we should continue. I don't want to waste time."

Despite the exhaustion—Cassian smiled. There it was again. That flicker of who Torin had been. Brilliant, driven, impatient with inefficiency.

Not gone. Just buried. Waiting to grow back.

"All right," Cassian said. "Let's practice."

---

Two days later, after rest and recovery, Cassian returned to the markets. This time hunting different prey.

He'd spotted three more emissaries since Perin's restoration. Memorized their patterns, their territories, their methods. But he couldn't restore them yet. His mind was still recovering from bearing Perin's weight.

Instead, he watched. Learned. Prepared.

And wondered if anyone would come for Perin. If Draven would retaliate.

The answer came not with violence, but with a presence.

Cassian felt it first—a wrongness in the air, like pressure before a storm. The Coin of Heads burned hot in his pocket, warning him. He turned, scanning the market crowd.

There.

A man standing perfectly still amid the flowing chaos. Not hollow—his shimmer was too bright for that, too vivid. But wrong in a different way. Like looking at a reflection that didn't quite match its source.

The man smiled and began walking toward Cassian.

Not threatening. Not hurried. Just... inevitable.

Cassian's hand closed around both coins. "Mira. Go."

"What—"

"*Go.*" His voice was sharp. "Find the guard. Tell them there's—" He paused. What was there to tell them? A man walking through a market? "Just go. Please."

Mira looked at the approaching figure and went pale. She'd learned to recognize danger. She ran.

The man stopped a few paces from Cassian, still smiling. "You don't remember me."

Cassian studied him through the Coin of Heads. The shimmer was... complicated. Layered. As if multiple contracts had been written over the same soul, each one adding another texture. "Should I?"

"We met briefly. In Millhaven. Before you understood what you were." The man's smile widened. "I was testing you then. Seeing if the rumors were true. If Rowan's son had inherited his father's... peculiarities."

"And?"

"You passed. Which is why my master sent me now." The man gestured casually. "He's not happy about Perin. The loophole was supposed to remain hidden."

"Good."

"Is it?" The man tilted his head. "Perin is dead, you know. Draven found him last night. Made an example. His daughter watched."

Cassian's blood went cold. "You're lying."

"Am I?" The man's shimmer rippled with something that might have been amusement. "Your Coin grants you authority over mind. Use it. Look into my mind and see if I'm lying."

Cassian did. He entered the gray space and looked at the man's thoughts.

He wasn't lying.

Perin was dead. Elena had watched her father—briefly human, briefly whole—cut down by hollow soldiers. The girl had screamed. Had begged. Had been ignored.

Then the memory twisted, showing Cassian something else. The same scene, but different. Perin alive, walking away with his daughter. Safe. Happy. Whole.

Two versions of the same event, layered over each other like thin pages overlapping.

"Which one is real?" Cassian demanded.

"Both. Neither." The man shrugged. "Does it matter? The point is that you don't know. You restored an emissary, sent him off with nothing but hope, and now you'll never know if he lived or died. If his daughter got her father back or watched him bleed out."

"Why are you here?"

"To deliver a message." The man's smile faded. "My master is prepared to escalate. You've discovered his loophole, so he's closing it. New contracts are being written—ironclad, specific, inescapable. The emissaries you could have saved will now be bound forever." The man leaned closer. "But there's one you can still reach. One he's left vulnerable on purpose."

"A trap."

"Obviously. But also an opportunity." The man pulled a small card from his pocket, black ink on white paper. An address. "This emissary has been hollow for a decade. Converted three hundred people personally. Carries the weight of every life he ruined. If you can restore him—if your mental fortitude is strong enough—you'll have saved someone worth saving. And proven your method works even on the deeply broken."

Cassian stared at the card. "And if I can't?"

"Then you'll learn your limits." The man placed the card in Cassian's palm. "He'll be at that address tomorrow at dawn. Alone. Waiting. He wants to be freed. Whether he deserves it..." The man smiled. "That's for you to decide."

Then he was gone, disappearing into the crowd as if he'd never existed.

Cassian stood holding the card, feeling its weight.

A trap. Obviously. But if even one word of it was true—if there was an emissary waiting to be freed, carrying that much weight, and Cassian walked away—

Could he live with that?

---

That evening, Cassian sat with Torin in the healing ward, holding the black card.

"It's a trap," Torin observed without needing to read it.

"Obviously."

"But you're considering it anyway."

"Yes." Cassian turned the card over in his hands. "Because if it's real—if there's someone there who wants to be freed—I can't just ignore it."

"He'll manipulate you. That's what Draven does." Torin's voice was flat. "He'll show you carefully selected truths. Make the hollowing seem reasonable. Necessary. He'll make you doubt everything you're doing."

"I know."

"And you'll go anyway."

"I have to. Because if there's even a small chance I can learn something—understand something—that helps me fight him more effectively..." Cassian met Torin's eyes. "Then it's worth the risk."

Torin was quiet for a long moment. Then: "You're assuming you'll recognize the manipulation when it happens. That you'll be able to separate truth from lies. But Draven has decades of experience. You have weeks. That's not a fair match."

"No. It's not." Cassian smiled grimly. "But I have something he doesn't."

"What?"

"The Coin of Heads. Authority over the realm of mind." Cassian pulled it out, feeling its familiar weight. "If he tries to manipulate me—twist my thoughts, plant false beliefs—I'll see it. I can see the state of someone's mind, every detail. Including my own."

"That assumes the coin makes you immune. What if Draven's manipulation is subtle enough that even you can't detect it?"

"Then I'll have learned something valuable: that I'm not as strong as I thought." Cassian pocketed the coin. "But I won't know unless I try."

Torin's expression didn't change, but something shifted in his posture. "You're going to get yourself killed."

"Your sister said the same thing."

"She's probably right."

"Probably." Cassian stood, wincing at the lingering exhaustion in his bones. "But if I don't go, someone who wants to be freed stays hollow. And Draven learns I'm not willing to take risks. That I can be controlled through fear."

"So you're choosing the trap over caution."

"I'm choosing to try instead of giving up." Cassian headed for the door, then paused. "If I don't come back—if this breaks me—tell your sister what happened. Tell her..." He trailed off. What was there to say? "Tell her it was worth trying."

"That's unnecessarily dramatic. You'll probably survive."

"Probably." Cassian smiled. "But just in case."

After he left, Torin sat alone in the dark ward, holding the cooling tea.

He tried to feel something about Cassian walking into danger. Concern. Fear. Hope.

Nothing came.

But he remembered—intellectually, distantly—that once he would have felt all of those things. That once, a friend risking his life would have mattered.

And somewhere deep in his fragmented mind, something whispered that it *should* matter again.

That the absence of feeling wasn't peace. It was just emptiness wearing peace's name.

So he sat with the tea and practiced what Cassian had taught him.

Connecting the sensation of warmth to the memory of safety.

Safety to the concept of friendship.

Friendship to the understanding that Cassian might die tomorrow.

And slowly—painfully slowly—something resembling worry began to form.

It hurt. It was messy. It was uncomfortable.

But it was real.

And real was better than empty.

So Torin kept practicing, growing new connections from ash.

Hoping they'd be strong enough to matter when morning came.

Miles away, in a tent on the edge of Hollow territory, Draven Kane looked at his golden locket and smiled.

"He'll come," he told the trapped coin inside. "Your son. He's too curious not to."

The coin pulsed—whether in agreement or protest, Draven couldn't tell. Not that it mattered.

"I won't kill him. That would be wasteful." Draven traced a finger across his maps. "But I will show him the truth. About his methods. About the cost of restoration. About why the hollowing is mercy, not cruelty."

He pulled out a ledger, flipping to a specific page. Marcus Thel. Ten years hollow. Three thousand conversions personally conducted. The weight of every life he'd ruined carried in his empty shell.

"Perfect," Draven murmured.

Tomorrow, he'd show Cassian what happened when someone tried to restore an emissary carrying that much accumulated debt. Show him what it felt like to bear the weight of three thousand stolen souls.

And when Cassian's mind broke under the burden—when he finally understood that some people were too hollow to save, that some weights couldn't be carried—he'd see the truth.

Emptiness wasn't the enemy.

It was the only shelter in a world where caring meant suffering without end.

Draven closed the ledger and settled in to wait.

Patience had always been his greatest weapon.

And tomorrow, it would break his most dangerous enemy.

Not through force.

But through understanding.

The cruelest trap of all.
