# Chapter 9

The Hollow camp sprawled across the valley like an infection—dozens of tents arranged in precise, unnatural rows. No campfires. No conversation. Just silent figures moving between structures with mechanical purpose.

Cassian crouched beside Mira on the ridge overlooking the camp, watching the patterns. The Hollow moved in synchronized shifts, their coordination too perfect to be coincidence. They were still connected to something. Still being directed.

"There," Mira whispered, pointing to a larger tent near the center. "That's where they're keeping the new ones. The ones they haven't fully converted yet."

"How do you know?"

"Because they guard it differently. See? The Hollow around the perimeter walk random patterns. But the ones near that tent follow specific routes. Predictable." Her voice dropped. "They're protecting something valuable."

Cassian studied the movements, seeing what she meant. The guards near the center tent orbited in fixed loops, never deviating. "How long have you been watching this camp?"

"Three days. Since I found out Torin was here." Mira's jaw was tight. "I've been trying to figure out how to get inside. Every plan I came up with ended with me dead or hollowed."

"Then why bring me?"

"Because you have something they don't." She gestured to his chest, where the coin rested beneath his shirt. "Power. Real power. Not just stolen fragments. If anyone can break their connection and free him, it's you."

Cassian wasn't sure if that was faith or desperation. Maybe both.

"The shift changes in twenty minutes," Mira said. "That's our window. The Hollow rotate positions, and for about ninety seconds, there's a gap in the coverage near the southeast corner. We can slip through there, get to the tent, find Torin, and get out before they realize what's happening."

"And if they realize sooner?"

"Then we fight. Or run. Or die." Mira met his eyes. "But I'm going in either way. With or without you."

Cassian looked at the camp again. At the Hollow moving through the darkness like puppets on invisible strings. He thought about the network he'd sensed during the battle—the vast web of connections binding them all together. And he thought about what it would mean to sever even one of those threads.

*Will it work?* he wondered. *Can I actually break Draven's hold on someone? Or will trying just alert him to what I'm doing?*

The coin pulsed warm against his chest. Not an answer. Just awareness. The presence in the Silent Market watching, waiting to see what he'd choose.

"Alright," Cassian said quietly. "We go together. But if this goes wrong—if they corner us—you run. Don't wait for me. Just get out and warn the King."

"I'm not leaving my brother."

"You will if I tell you to. Because if we both die here, no one will know what happened. No one will be able to warn anyone about what's coming." Cassian's voice was firm. "Promise me. If I say run, you run."

Mira's expression was pained, but she nodded. "I promise."

"Good." Cassian checked his knife, made sure the coin was secure. "Then let's go get your brother."

---

They moved during the shift change, slipping through the gap in the patrol routes exactly as Mira had predicted. The Hollow didn't react. Didn't turn. Didn't seem to notice two living people moving through their camp.

*They're focused inward,* Cassian realized. *Listening to the network. It's telling them what to do, and it doesn't think we're a threat yet.*

They reached the central tent without incident. Mira pulled the flap aside, and they ducked inside.

The interior was worse than Cassian had imagined.

Twenty cots lined the walls, each holding a person in various stages of conversion. Some still looked human—eyes open, aware, terrified. Others had already started to hollow out, their expressions going flat, their movements becoming mechanical. And a few were completely gone, their eyes empty, their humanity drained.

"Torin," Mira breathed, moving toward one of the middle cots.

The young man lying there looked like her—same dark hair, same sharp features. But his eyes were distant, unfocused. He stared at the tent ceiling as if watching something no one else could see.

"Torin, it's me. It's Mira. Can you hear me?"

No response. Just that empty stare.

Cassian knelt beside the cot, placing his hand on Torin's forehead. The coin pulsed, and suddenly he could *feel* it—the thread connecting Torin to the network. A tether running from his mind to something vast and terrible and far away. The connection was draining him. Pulling out memories, emotions, identity. Storing them somewhere else. Leaving only the shell.

"He's still connected," Cassian said. "Draven's network is actively hollowing him out. If we don't sever the link soon, there won't be anything left to save."

"Can you break it?" Mira's voice was desperate.

"I don't know. I've never tried anything like this." Cassian closed his eyes, focusing on the connection. "But I can try."

He reached for the coin's power, letting it flow through him. The Silent Market opened at the edges of his awareness—not fully, just enough to touch the laws underlying reality. He found the thread binding Torin to the network and examined it.

The connection was complex. Not just a simple tether, but a web of tiny filaments, each one carrying a different aspect of Torin's humanity. Memories. Feelings. Desires. All of it flowing away like water through a sieve.

*To break this, I have to cut every filament simultaneously. Otherwise, the remaining threads will just compensate, and the drain will continue.*

Cassian focused, gathering the coin's power. Then, in one sharp mental motion, he severed the connection.

Torin gasped, his back arching. His eyes went wide, suddenly focused. "Mira?"

"I'm here! I'm here, I've got you—"

But then something else happened. Something Cassian hadn't anticipated.

The network *noticed*.

He felt it turn its attention toward them like a spotlight swinging around. Felt the vast intelligence behind it register the severed connection. Felt it *respond*.

Guards appeared at the tent entrance. Not Hollow moving on patrol routes, but directed. Purposeful. They moved with eerie precision, blocking the exit.

"We need to go," Cassian said, pulling Torin to his feet. "Now."

They ran for the back of the tent, Cassian using his knife to slash through the canvas. They burst out into the night air—and found more Hollow waiting.

The camp was mobilizing. Hollow converging from every direction, their movements synchronized. The network was coordinating them, directing them to intercept.

"East side!" Mira shouted. "There's a gap in the perimeter there—"

They ran, half-dragging Torin between them. The young man was conscious but disoriented, his legs barely able to support him. Behind them, the Hollow gave chase, their footsteps perfectly synchronized, their pursuit relentless.

Cassian reached the perimeter fence—a simple rope barrier marking the camp's edge—and cut through it. They stumbled into the darkness beyond, racing toward the ridge where they'd left their horses.

*We're not going to make it,* Cassian thought as more Hollow appeared ahead of them, cutting off their escape route. *There are too many. The network is coordinating too well.*

He turned, ready to fight, ready to use the coin's power to—

One of the Hollow stepped forward. Blocking the others. Not attacking. Just... standing there.

The Hollow's eyes were empty like all the rest. But there was something in his posture. Something deliberate.

"Go," the Hollow said. His voice was flat, emotionless. But the word was clear. Intentional.

"Korrin?" Mira whispered.

The Hollow—Korrin—didn't respond. Didn't acknowledge her. He just stood there, blocking the path of the other Hollow, buying them seconds they desperately needed.

"Run," Korrin said again. Still no emotion. No inflection. Just the word.

Cassian didn't need to be told twice. He grabbed Torin and Mira and ran.

Behind them, the Hollow swarmed around Korrin. The network reasserting control. But for those few critical seconds, one Hollow had chosen to disobey. Had chosen to help.

*Not all the way gone,* Cassian thought as they reached the horses and mounted. *Some part of him is still in there. Still fighting.*

They rode into the darkness, leaving the camp behind. Cassian could feel the network's attention on them—could sense its frustration at the broken connection, the lost asset. But it didn't pursue further. Didn't risk more Hollow in the open.

*It's conserving resources,* Cassian realized. *Draven knows he can't afford to waste Hollow on a chase. Not when he needs them for the siege.*

They ran.

Behind them, Korrin stood watching until they disappeared into the darkness. Then, mechanically, he turned and walked back toward the camp. Back to his orders. Back to the emptiness.

But for nine seconds, something human had flickered in those hollow eyes.
