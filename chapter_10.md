# Chapter 10: Debt of the Dead

They brought Torin back to the palace in the gray hours before dawn.

Cassian watched from the window of his quarters as the cart rolled through the eastern gate, Mira walking beside it with one hand on her brother's shoulder. Torin sat upright but hunched, staring at his hands like they belonged to someone else. Which, in a way, they had—until three nights ago.

Three nights since the infiltration. Three nights since Cassian had touched the network and felt the vast web of stolen humanity stretching across the kingdom. Three nights since he'd learned the terrible truth: every Hollow freed condemned another to take their place.

He turned away from the window, his stomach churning.

The young woman's face still haunted him. The one who'd died because he'd severed Torin's connection. Blood from her nose and ears. Dead within the hour. The Law had demanded balance, and an innocent had paid the price Cassian couldn't afford.

*One saved. One killed. Perfect balance.*

Draven's words, spoken through the hollow guard's mouth, echoed in his memory. The network was designed to transfer cost. Every disruption created a cascade—debt flowing like water seeking its level, always finding someone to bear it.

How many more would die if Cassian tried to free others? How many innocents would the Law sacrifice to maintain its precious equilibrium?

The coin in his pocket pulsed warm against his ribs. Cassian pressed his palm against it, as if he could still the questions it couldn't answer.

A knock at the door. Mira's voice, hoarse with exhaustion: "Cassian? Can we come in?"

He opened the door. Mira looked like she hadn't slept since the infiltration—dark circles under her eyes, her braid coming undone, her shoulders tight with a tension that wouldn't release. Behind her, Torin stood in the hallway, his gaze unfocused.

"How is he?" Cassian asked quietly.

"Better. Worse. I don't know." Mira guided her brother inside and sat him in the chair by the window. Torin moved compliantly, like a child being positioned for a portrait. "He remembers things sometimes. Has conversations. Almost seems normal. Then he'll just... drift. Stop responding. Like parts of him are still missing."

Cassian knelt before Torin, studying the young man's face. His eyes held more awareness than they had in the tent—flickers of personality, emotion, recognition. But there were gaps. Silences where spontaneous thought should be.

"Torin," Cassian said gently. "Do you know where you are?"

Torin's eyes focused slowly. "Palace. Capital." A pause, longer than it should be. "Arvenstead. King Aldric's city." Another pause. "Why am I here?"

"Your sister brought you. To keep you safe."

"Safe from what?"

Mira's voice cracked. "From the people who hurt you. From going back to being... what you were."

Torin considered this with an expression that was almost curious. "I don't remember being hurt. I remember feeling peaceful. Empty in a good way. Like a weight lifted." Then, quieter: "Now the weight is back. But I don't remember what it is. Just that it's heavy."

Cassian exchanged a glance with Mira. The hollowing hadn't been completely reversed. Torin had resisted the reconnection—had fought against returning to the network—but the damage remained. Memories lost. Emotions disconnected. Identity fragmented.

He was better than hollow. But he wasn't whole.

"We'll figure it out," Cassian said, though he had no idea how. "You're free now. That's what matters."

"Am I?" Torin tilted his head, and for a moment his expression sharpened into something uncomfortably lucid. "Or did you just trade one cage for another?"

Before Cassian could respond, Torin's eyes unfocused again. The lucidity drained away like water through cupped hands. He turned to stare out the window, silent and distant.

Mira touched her brother's shoulder, got no response, and moved to the far corner of the room where they could speak privately.

"Is this what success looks like?" she asked bitterly. "I got him back, but he's not *him*. He's a ghost wearing my brother's face."

"He's alive," Cassian said. "He's aware. That's more than the others have."

"Is it enough?"

The question had no good answer. Cassian had saved one person at the cost of another's life, and the person saved was still broken. What kind of victory was that?

"The coin in my pocket is still burning," Cassian said quietly, changing the subject because he couldn't bear to hold it. "There's another one nearby. Somewhere in this palace."

Mira's exhaustion gave way to sharp attention. "Another coin? Like yours?"

"Another fragment. Similar, but different. Power from the same source." Cassian pulled out his coin, felt its fevered warmth. "It's been calling to mine for days. I think it's in the treasury."

"And you want to find it."

"I *need* to find it. If I'm going to counter Draven, if I'm going to find a way to actually free the Hollow without killing innocents in the process—" He stopped, frustrated. "I need more power. More understanding. My coin shows me value and exchange, but it can't undo what Draven's done. Maybe with two coins, I can."

Mira was quiet for a long moment, her gaze drifting to her brother. "Will it help Torin? Can it restore what he lost?"

"I don't know. Maybe." Cassian met her eyes. "I have no idea what a second coin might do yet. But if anything could restore what was taken..."

Hope flickered across Mira's face, quickly suppressed. "Then we find it. Today. Whatever it takes."

---

Getting access to the treasury required convincing the King's chamberlain that Draven's agents might reach it first. Finally, as midday bells tolled across the city, Cassian and Mira were escorted through the eastern wing by a nervous clerk named Petras.

"The treasury hasn't been fully inventoried in twenty years," Petras explained as they descended a spiral staircase into the palace's depths. "King Aldric's father was... particular about his collections. Some items were inherited, some were gifts, some were seized from traitors. The records are incomplete."

"We're looking for something specific," Cassian said. The coin in his pocket was almost unbearably hot now. "A medallion or large coin. Heavy. Warm to the touch. Possibly very old."

"There are hundreds of coins in the collection. Foreign currency, ancient denominations, commemorative pieces—"

"This one will feel different. Trust me."

The treasury vault was smaller than Cassian expected—a square chamber maybe twenty feet across, its walls lined with wooden shelves and locked cabinets. But the *value* of what it contained made his head swim. Even without touching the coin, he could feel the layers of worth: gold and jewels and rare artifacts, yes, but also the intangible weight of power, status, legitimacy. Every crown and scepter and ceremonial sword carried the accumulated authority of generations.

And beneath it all, pulsing like a drum, was the other coin.

"There," Cassian said, pointing to a corner cabinet.

Petras fumbled with his keys. The cabinet was locked three times over, protected by mechanisms that clicked and rattled as he worked them open. Inside were velvet-lined drawers, each containing carefully arranged treasures: rings set with enormous gemstones, golden chains thick as rope, ornate daggers in jeweled sheaths.

And in the bottom drawer, resting on a bed of black velvet, was the coin.

It was smaller than Cassian's—about one inch in diameter—and its surface was etched with different symbols. Where his coin showed smooth black on one side and rough gold on the other, this one appeared to be gold that had aged to a muted sheen, almost copper-like in the shadows. But the moment Cassian's fingers brushed it, he felt the resonance.

The same unnatural weight. The same feverish warmth. The same sense of vast, patient power waiting to be used.

"That's it?" Mira asked, peering over his shoulder. Her voice held barely suppressed urgency.

Cassian lifted the coin carefully. The moment it left the velvet, his own coin flared hot enough to burn. He gasped, nearly dropping both of them.

And then the presence in the Silent Market *surged*.

For the first time since inheriting his coin, Cassian felt the thing that dwelled in that gray space awaken fully. Not just watching now. *Active*. And it was interested in what he'd found.

*Ah,* it seemed to whisper directly into his mind. *The Emblem of Seeds. I wondered where this one had gone.*

"Cassian?" Mira's hand on his arm, steadying him. "What's wrong?"

"Nothing. I just—" He shook his head, trying to clear the ringing in his ears. "The two coins are resonating. It's like they recognize each other."

Petras was watching nervously. "Is it valuable? Should I note it in the inventory?"

"It's..." Cassian started to say "priceless," but stopped himself. To Petras, to the King, to anyone who couldn't feel what he felt, this was just an old bronze coin. Curious, perhaps. Historical. But not the fragment of divine power that it actually was. "It's interesting. I'd like to study it further. With the King's permission."

"I'll have to ask the chamberlain—"

"I'll handle that," Mira interjected smoothly. "You've been very helpful, Petras. We won't take up more of your time."

The clerk looked relieved to be dismissed. As soon as he was gone, Mira turned to Cassian with an intensity that made him step back.

"Can you bond with it?" she asked. "Right now?"

"I need to take it from the treasury first. The King doesn't know what this is, but it belongs to the crown. I can't just steal it—even for a good cause."

"What would it take?" Mira pressed. "To bond with it? To learn to use it?"

Cassian studied her face, seeing something desperate there. "Time. Meditation. Days, maybe. I'd have to understand its nature, accept its purpose. Why?"

"Because maybe it can fix Torin." She gripped his arm. "Maybe it can restore what was taken from him. The memories. The connections. Make him whole again."

"Maybe," Cassian said carefully. "But I don't know that for certain. And bonding with a second coin—I don't even know if it's possible."

"Then try." Mira's voice was fierce. "Please, Cassian. He's all I have left. If there's even a chance this could save him—"

"I'll try," Cassian promised. "But first I need to convince the King to let me use it."

---

The King granted Cassian an audience that evening. They met in the same small council chamber where Cassian had first demonstrated his power—the room where he'd extracted Lord Corvan's memories and proven the existence of his coin.

"Lord Cassian," King Aldric said, gesturing to a chair. "My chamberlain tells me you've been exploring the treasury. Find anything interesting?"

"Another coin," Cassian said simply. He pulled it from his pocket and set it on the table between them. "Similar to mine. Another fragment."

The King's expression sharpened. "Another one? So there are more than just yours and Draven's?"

"Seven in total, according to ancient texts my father researched. Draven has one. I have one. This makes three accounted for." Cassian met the King's gaze. "If Draven collects them all, he'll have power beyond comprehension."

"And you want to collect them first."

"I want to keep them from him," Cassian corrected. "This one's been dormant for decades. Whoever it belonged to is either dead or far from here. If it stays in that vault, it's useless. But if I can learn to use it—"

"You already have one coin. You want two?"

"I need two. Your Majesty, three nights ago I freed a Hollow from Draven's network. One man, restored to awareness and identity. Do you know what it cost?" Cassian's voice went hard. "An innocent woman died. The Law transferred the debt to her. All the suffering that man was carrying—all the weight Draven had offloaded onto him—it had to go somewhere. So it went to her. Killed her in an hour."

The King's face paled. "You're certain?"

"I watched it happen. Draven showed me, through the network. He wanted me to understand: the system is designed to transfer cost. Every Hollow I free will kill someone else unless I can find another way." Cassian gestured to the second coin. "This coin might give me a way. A different approach. A different kind of power. If anything can undo what Draven's done—if anything can restore the Hollow without killing innocents—this might be it."

The King was quiet for a long moment, his fingers drumming on the table. "Let me tell you something about powerful artifacts, Cassian. My father collected them obsessively. Swords that supposedly never dulled. Crowns that granted authority. Rings that protected from poison. You know what they all had in common?"

"They didn't work?"

"They worked exactly as well as the person wielding them believed they would work. My father wore that crown for thirty years, convinced it made him a better king. It didn't. But the belief did." The King's eyes were hard. "I don't know if your coins are divine or delusional. But I do know that the man who saved one Hollow at terrible cost—who's willing to sacrifice pieces of himself to save others—that man is worth more than any artifact."

Cassian felt his throat tighten. "Your Majesty—"

"I'm not finished." The King stood, pacing to the window. "I've watched you since you arrived. Watched the trades you make. The prices you pay. You're destroying yourself one piece at a time, and you call it heroism." He turned. "If you take this second coin, how much more will you lose? How much more can you afford to lose before there's nothing left?"

"As much as it takes."

"That's what I'm afraid of." The King's voice softened. "But I'll give you the coin anyway. It's been sitting in that vault for forty years, doing nothing. If you can use it to save even one more person without killing an innocent, then it's worth whatever price you pay. But—" He held up a hand as Cassian started to speak. "I'm not accepting payment. No trade. No exchange. Consider it a gift."

Cassian stared at the coin on the table. Everything in him screamed that accepting without equivalent exchange was wrong. Dangerous. That debts unpaid created consequences.

But the King was offering him a chance. A way forward that didn't require carving more pieces from himself. And in truth, there was no time for elaborate negotiations. Draven's message had been clear—the confrontation was coming. Soon.

"I'll try to bond with it tonight," Cassian said quietly. "See if it's even possible to master two coins. If it is..." He met the King's gaze. "Thank you, Your Majesty."

"Don't thank me. Just don't waste it. Or yourself." The King gestured to the door. "Now get out. I have a kingdom to run. You have work to do."

---

Cassian returned to his quarters to find Mira sitting beside Torin, speaking quietly to her brother. Torin was staring out the window, his expression distant but not quite empty. Whatever Mira was saying seemed to anchor him—keeping him present even if he couldn't fully engage.

"I have it," Cassian said, pulling the second coin from his pocket. "The King gave it to me."

Mira's eyes lit with something between hope and desperation. "Can you bond with it tonight? Start learning how to use it?"

"I'll try. But Mira, even if I succeed, I don't know if it can help Torin. This is all—"

"I know." She cut him off, her voice strained. "I know it's a guess. But it's the only hope I have. So please. Try."

Cassian nodded. He moved to the desk and laid both coins out before him—his coin with a smooth gold surface; the new coin showing a rougher, muted sheen and new symbols. They gleamed in the candlelight, and he could feel the resonance between them. Recognition. Complementary purposes.

He glanced at Mira and Torin. "This might take hours. If I succeed in bonding with it, I'll be... elsewhere. In the Silent Market. Don't disturb me unless something's wrong."

"We'll be quiet," Mira promised. She returned to her brother's side, speaking in low tones.

Cassian sat, closed his eyes, and reached for both coins.

---

The Silent Market opened like a vast door swinging wide.

It was different this time. Deeper. More expansive. Where before Cassian had seen abstract impressions of value—flickers and shimmers representing what things were worth—now he saw the entire web of exchange that connected the palace.

Every person, every object, every obligation and debt and gift. Threads of value linking everything to everything else in an impossibly complex tapestry. The new coin was showing him something his coin couldn't—not just what things were worth, but how they grew. How they connected. How value propagated through time.

At the center of it all, the presence waited.

Except now Cassian could see it wasn't singular. Two presences intertwined—his coin and the new coin, both aware, both ancient, both curious about what he would do.

*You've found another,* they whispered together, voices overlapping like harmonies. *A sister fragment. It complements your gift beautifully.*

"Can I use both?" Cassian asked the vastness. "Can one person bond with two coins?"

*It has never been attempted. But these are not normal times.* A pause, as if the presences were considering. *The one who cheats the Emblem of Oxen seeks others. If he collects all seven, he will reshape reality itself. Perhaps the only counter is for someone else to master multiple fragments.*

"What would it cost? To bond with this second coin?"

*Understand its purpose. Every fragment governs a different domain of trade. Yours shows you exchanges of knowledge, memory, perception. This one governs exchanges of a different nature—growth for potential, seeds for harvest, patience for abundance. You would have to learn its language. Accept that some things cannot be rushed through cleverness alone.*

"I accept," Cassian said.

The second coin flared hot in his hand—not burning, but warming like earth in sunlight. He felt it reaching toward him, its power seeking purchase in his mind. Looking for compatibility. For readiness.

And then it bonded.

The sensation was different from when his first coin had chosen him. That had been sharp, invasive, a sudden flood of perception. This was more gradual. Patient. Like roots spreading through soil.

Cassian felt his awareness expand. Part of him remained attuned to his first coin—seeing value, understanding exchange, calculating worth. But another part now sensed something different. *Potential*. The shape of what could be, given time and care.

Together, the two perspectives created something new. He could see not just what things were worth now, but what they could *become*. Not just how to trade for outcomes, but how to cultivate them. How to plant seeds and nurture them into growth.

*Now,* the presences whispered, *you have the tools to counter what has been built. Your first fragment shows you the network's structure. This fragment shows you how to grow identity. Together, they might restore what was taken.*

"Might," Cassian repeated. "But you don't know for certain."

*We are fragments of a broken whole. Our knowledge is incomplete. But the potential is there. Whether you can realize it depends on your mastery. Your understanding. Your willingness to pay the price.*

"What price?"

*The same as always. To restore identity to those made hollow, you would need to grow new connections in place of severed ones. That requires seed-material. Memories. Emotions. Identity. Pieces of yourself planted in their emptiness, nurtured until they take root and become something new—not yours, but rooted in yours.*

Cassian's blood ran cold. "You mean I'd have to give them parts of myself? My memories, my identity?"

*Not copies. Not gifts. Actual pieces, transferred and transformed. You would lose them. They would gain them as seeds. And with time and cultivation, those fragments would grow into their own authentic identity.*

"That's..." Cassian struggled for words. "That's still trading away pieces of myself."

*Yes. But with a different purpose. Your first coin trades for immediate exchange. This coin trades for future growth. The cost is similar. The outcome may be different. Whether it works—* A pause. *That remains to be seen.*

Cassian pulled his awareness back, his mind reeling. He could save the Hollow—truly save them, restore their identity and awareness—but it would require planting pieces of himself in each one. How many could he save before there was nothing left of him to plant?

He opened his eyes. The room swam back into focus—candles burning low, night deep outside, Mira and Torin still sitting by the window.

Mira noticed him stirring and hurried over. "Did it work? Did you bond with it?"

"Yes," Cassian said. His voice felt distant, like it was coming from somewhere else. "I have both now. Two coins bonded to me."

"Can you help Torin?" The desperation in her voice was naked. Raw. "Can you restore what he lost?"

Cassian looked at her brother. Saw the fragments of identity struggling to cohere. Saw the gaps where memories and emotions should be. And he saw, with his new dual vision, how those gaps could be filled. Seeds planted. Growth nurtured. Given time and care and enough of himself, he could make Torin whole again.

"I think so," Cassian said quietly. "But I need time. Need to understand how to use both coins together. Need to practice with smaller restorations first."

Hope and relief flooded Mira's face. "Thank you. Thank you, Cassian."

"Don't thank me yet. I don't know if it will work. But I'll try." He stood, feeling the exhaustion of the bonding process weighing on him. "I need rest. Tomorrow, we'll begin."

Mira nodded, returning to her brother's side. Cassian moved to his sleeping area—a small chamber connected to the main room by an archway. He placed both coins, wrapped in cloth, on the small table beside his bed, then collapsed onto the mattress.

Through the archway, he could hear Mira and Torin speaking quietly. Her voice soft and soothing, his responses halting and confused. The sounds faded as exhaustion pulled him into slumber.

---

In the main room, Mira sat with her brother, holding his hand as Cassian's breathing deepened into sleep in the adjacent chamber.

"Do you remember our mother?" she asked gently. "Her garden? The roses she loved?"

Torin frowned. "Roses. Yes. Red? Or... I can't picture them. I know I should remember. But it's like looking through fog."

"It's all right. It will come back. Cassian will help—"

Torin's hand suddenly gripped hers tighter. His eyes went distant, unfocused. And when he spoke again, his voice was flat. Calm. And utterly wrong.

"Mira." He turned to face her, but his eyes didn't focus on her face. They looked past her. Through her. "He wants to speak with you."

Mira's blood ran cold. "Who wants to speak?"

"The Supreme Voice. He says he can fix me. Make me whole. Give back everything I lost." A pause. "He says he'll do it. But you have to bring him something first."

---

The next morning, Cassian woke to find Mira already up, sitting with Torin by the window in the main room. She looked exhausted, as if she hadn't slept at all.

"Council meeting in an hour," Cassian said, rubbing his eyes as he emerged from his sleeping chamber. "The King wants to discuss troop movements."

Mira nodded but didn't meet his eyes. "I'll stay with Torin."

Something felt off. Her voice was too controlled. Too careful. But Cassian was still foggy from sleep and the previous night's bonding. He gathered his belongings, checked that both coins were still on his bedside table, then tucked them carefully into his inner pocket. Whatever happened, he couldn't leave them unguarded.

The meeting dragged on for hours. Military advisors argued about defensive positions. Nobles complained about resource allocation. Cassian contributed what he could about the Hollow's methods, but his mind kept drifting to the coins in his pocket. To the possibility of restoring the Hollow.

By the time the council adjourned at dusk, Cassian's head was pounding. He returned to his quarters—and immediately felt something wrong.

The bond to the second coin *stretched*. Like a rope going taut.

He reached into his pocket and pulled out both wrapped coins. His primary coin was there, warm and present. But the second one—

He unwrapped it. A piece of plain copper stared back at him, roughly the same size and weight.

*What? How...?*

And then he remembered. This morning, when he was still foggy with sleep. Mira had offered him tea while he gathered his things. He'd set the coins down on the table for just a moment while he drank it. Had Mira switched them then? She would have only had seconds—she must have prepared the fake coin during the night, wrapped it identically.

Cassian's stomach dropped. Through the archway to the main room, he could see Torin sitting alone by the window.

"Where's Mira?" Cassian asked, already knowing the answer.

Torin blinked slowly. "She said she needed air. Needed to walk. She left maybe... an hour ago? I think. Time is hard."

"Did she say where she was going?" Cassian asked, fighting to keep his voice calm.

"The gardens, maybe? Or the eastern wall? She said she needed to think." Torin's attention drifted back to the window. "I make her sad. I can see it. She looks at me and sees what's missing."

Cassian's' his mind was racing. *Why would she take the coin? Where would she go?*

He crossed through the archway into the main room, trying to think. Mira had been desperate about Torin's condition, but she'd also been loyal. Dedicated to helping Cassian master the coins. What could have changed in the last twelve hours?

And then Cassian remembered. Last night, when he'd been exhausted and foggy after bonding with both coins. He'd left Mira alone with Torin while he slept in the adjoining chamber.

"Torin," Cassian said carefully, "did something happen last night? After I went to sleep?"

Torin's gaze remained fixed on the window. "Happen?"

"Did anyone speak to you? Did Mira say anything to you? Or talk to anyone?"

A long pause. Then: "He came back."

Cassian furrowed his brow. "Who?"

"Draven. Through the thread. The one he never severed. He spoke through me again." Torin's voice was flat, distant. "To Mira. While she sat with me."

"What did he say?"

"That he could fix me. Really fix me." Torin gestured vaguely at himself. "But he needed your coin. She had to bring it to him."

Cassian felt rage and terror war in his chest. Draven had planned this. Had waited until Cassian was vulnerable, exhausted from bonding. Had used Torin as a messenger, knowing Mira would be alone with him.

"Why didn't you tell me?" Cassian demanded. "Why didn't she—"

Torin winced, trying to understand the depth of what he was recollecting. "She...I think she wanted to. But he said if she didn't come alone, he'd kill me before she arrived." Torin's voice dropped. "She was crying. I wanted to tell her not to go. That I wasn't worth saving. But I couldn't. The words wouldn't come."

Cassian wanted to scream. To punch something. But there was no time.

"How long ago did she leave?"

"An hour. Maybe more. Time is..."

Cassian was already moving toward the door. "Stay here, Torin. If I don't come back by morning, tell King Aldric everything."

He left at a run, the bond to the stolen coin pulling at his awareness like a compass. At least an hour's head start. She was probably already there, already making the trade.

But the bond remained. He could track her.

*Let her think she's making the trade alone,* Cassian thought as he sprinted through the palace corridors. *Let Draven think he's won. Then I'll find them both.*

---

Cassian navigated the palace corridors at a sprint, following the bond's pull. Down stairs, through the eastern wing, past startled servants and guards. The bond stretched further with each step. The coin was moving toward the city's northern edge.

*The aqueduct,* Cassian thought.

He burst through the postern gate into the streets beyond. The sun was setting, casting long shadows across the cobblestones. The bond pulled him north and east, through twisting streets toward the old district.

She was already too far ahead to catch. An hour's head start meant she was probably already there, already making the trade. But the bond remained—weak but present. He'd bonded with the coin before she'd taken it, which meant even separated from it, he retained a connection. Could feel its direction. Its distance.

Could track it.

*She'll make the trade,* Cassian thought grimly as he ran. *Let Draven think he's won. Then I'll find them both.*

It was a terrible plan. Full of risks and desperate hopes. But Mira had made her choice, and now Cassian had to deal with the consequences.

He navigated through twisting streets, past shuttered shops and sleeping houses. The city watch was light tonight—most guards were on the walls, watching for external threats. No one expected the threat to already be inside.

As Cassian neared the aqueduct ruins, the bond suddenly *flared*. Not stronger, but more intense. Like someone had just touched the coin.

Draven had it. The meeting had happened.

Cassian broke into a full sprint.

He reached the ruins fifteen minutes later—a maze of broken stone arches and crumbling channels that had once carried water from the northern springs. Now they carried only darkness and the whispers of desperate people.

The bond pulled him deeper into the ruins, toward a section where three arches converged into a sheltered space. He could see light ahead—torchlight, casting dancing shadows on ancient stone.

And voices.

Cassian slowed, moving quietly now, staying in the shadows. He crept closer until he could see them.

---

Mira stood in the center of the space, her back straight but her hands trembling. Before her stood a man Cassian had only seen in brief glimpses during the Rothaven encounter—tall, lean, with dark hair and eyes that held no warmth. No emotion at all.

Draven Kane. The Supreme Voice. The architect of the Hollow.

And in his hand, unwrapped and gleaming in the torchlight, was the second coin.

"Interesting," Draven said softly. His voice was calm. Almost pleasant. "I asked for Cassian's coin." He turned the coin over in his palm, studying its symbols. "And you brought me Cassian's coin. Technically."

Mira's voice was steady despite her fear. "He bonded with it. It belongs to him. I upheld my end of the bargain."

"Yes, you did." Draven's smile was cold. "The Law recognizes this. I can feel the debt settling—the exchange is accepted. You brought me a coin that belongs to Cassian, and I owe you Torin's restoration." He paused, studying the coin. "Which is why I'm going to honor our agreement to the letter. And I will also show you why cleverness without wisdom is dangerous."

Mira stood still...unsure what to make of his words.

"This coin," Draven said, still in that terribly pleasant voice, "is useless to me. It governs a domain I have no interest in at the moment." He looked up at her. "But the Law doesn't care about my needs. Only whether the terms of the deal are met. And they were. So I will restore your brother."

Hope flickered across Mira's face. "You will?"

"Absolutely. I'll give him back his memories, his emotions, his sense of self. Every piece you wanted restored." Draven's smile widened, but it never reached his eyes. "The problem, dear girl, is that you only asked me to revive him. Not to *keep* him in a revived status."

Mira's face went white. "What?"

"This restoration will be temporary. Without ongoing work—the kind of careful cultivation Cassian would need weeks or months to learn—your brother will slip back into hollowness within days. Maybe hours." Draven tilted his head. "You see, when identity is torn away, it leaves scars. The vessel wants to be empty again. It's easier. More comfortable. Torin will get his memories back, feel all his pain and grief flooding in at once, and then slowly lose them again as his mind retreats back into the peace of emptiness."

"No," Mira whispered. "You're lying."

"I'm not. Ask Cassian when he arrives—and he will arrive, he's tracking that coin through your bond right now—he'll tell you. The coin he bonded with tonight might restore the Hollow permanently, but only if used with great skill and patience. Skills neither of you possess yet." Draven pocketed the coin casually. "So yes, I'll honor my bargain. But within a week, your brother will be hollow again. And you'll have gained nothing."

"You promised!" Mira's voice cracked.

"And I'll keep my promise. But that's the difference between you and me—you think in terms of what's fair. I only hold to the letter of my promises." Draven's expression didn't change. "You were clever enough to bring me a coin that technically fulfilled our bargain. But not wise enough to foresee how I'd fulfill mine."

"There has to be a way," Mira said desperately. "Some trade we can make—"

"Oh, there is." Draven's smile turned predatory. "Convince Cassian to give me his other coin. The one he's mastered. The one that shows him the network's structure. In exchange, I'll teach you how to make Torin's restoration permanent. How to use this new coin properly. How to save him completely."

"He'll never—"

"Then your brother returns to hollowness, and you'll he betrayed your friend for nothing." Draven looked past her into the shadows. "But why don't we ask him? He's been listening for the past few minutes."

Cassian stepped out of the shadows, his heart pounding.

Mira spun toward him, her face stricken. "Cassian, I—"

"I know," he said quietly. "I understand why you did it."

Draven's smile widened. "Cassian of Millhaven. Right on time. I was just teaching your friend here a lesson about reading the fine print." He gestured casually. "So you see," turning back to Mira, "your cleverness gained you nothing. Your brother will be restored, will suffer the rush of all his memories and grief returning, and then will slowly sink back into emptiness as his mind seeks the peace he once had. Unless—" He paused. "Unless Cassian gives me what I actually wanted. His first coin. The one that lets him tinker with my network."

"No," Cassian said immediately.

"Then the girl's sacrifice was pointless." Draven shrugged. "But I thank her for the coin anyway. Perhaps I'll find a use for it. The Law accepted the trade, and I've gained a fragment at no real cost to myself. A perfect transaction. Plus, I have you now."

He raised his hand, and from the shadows around the ruined aqueduct, figures emerged.

Hollow. Dozens of them. Moving with perfect, silent coordination.

"Now," Draven said, his pleasant tone never wavering. "Here's your choice, Cassian. Give me your primary coin—the one in your pocket right now—and I'll not only restore Torin permanently, I'll teach you how to do it yourself. Refuse, and his restoration will fade, and you'll both die knowing you could have saved him."

Cassian's hand went to his pocket. Felt his coin burning hot. Felt the second coin's distant warmth through the bond, now in Draven's possession.

And felt, deep in the Silent Market, the presence stirring. Watching to see what choice he would make.

*Trade your power for a chance to save them both. Or refuse and fight.*

Ten seconds to decide.

Nine.

Eight.

Cassian pulled his coin from his pocket and held it up in the torchlight.

"All right," he said quietly. "Let's talk about terms."
