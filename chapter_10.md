# Chapter 10: Debt of the Dead

The coin had been burning hot for three days.

Cassian stood in the King's private library, one hand pressed against the ancient stone wall, feeling the heat pulse through his pocket like a second heartbeat. Somewhere in this palace—somewhere close—another coin was calling to his.

"You're certain it's here?" Mira asked, browsing a shelf of military histories with feigned interest. They'd already been thrown out of two restricted sections by suspicious guards.

"It's close. Very close." Cassian closed his eyes, letting his perception expand. The impressions came in waves: old stone, older secrets, layers upon layers of accumulated value. The palace had been built over centuries, each generation adding rooms and vaults and hidden passages. "It's not just near the palace. It's *in* it. Part of the structure itself."

"That narrows it down to about a thousand rooms."

"Less than that." Cassian opened his eyes. "The resonance is strongest in the older sections. The original fortress, before the palace was expanded. That's the eastern wing, the royal apartments and—" He stopped. "The treasury."

"The treasury." Mira raised an eyebrow. "Well, that's not ominous at all. You think someone's been using it?"

"Or hiding it. Or they don't even know what they have." Cassian imagined many coins must have passed through ignorant hands, mistaken for curious relics or family heirlooms. "The Dealer told me to find the others before Draven does. If there's one here, I can't leave it."

Mira studied him for a moment. "And if whoever has it doesn't want to give it up?"

"Then I'll trade for it."

"With what? You've already given up your mother's face. Pieces of your childhood. How much more are you willing to sacrifice?"

The question hit harder than she intended. Cassian had been asking himself the same thing every night, lying awake in the palace quarters, feeling the empty spaces in his memory where important things used to be. But what choice did he have? If Draven collected more coins while Cassian hesitated...

"As much as it takes," he said quietly.

---

Getting access to the treasury required three days of negotiation with the King's chamberlain, two written requests, and one veiled threat about what would happen if Draven's agents reached it first. Finally, on the fourth morning, Cassian and Mira were escorted through the eastern wing by a nervous clerk named Petras.

"The treasury hasn't been fully inventoried in twenty years," Petras explained as they descended a spiral staircase into the palace's depths. "King Aldric's father was... particular about his collections. Some items were inherited, some were gifts, some were seized from traitors. The records are incomplete."

"We're looking for something specific," Cassian said. The coin in his pocket was almost unbearably hot now. "A medallion or large coin. Heavy. Warm to the touch. Possibly very old."

"There are hundreds of coins in the collection. Foreign currency, ancient denominations, commemorative pieces—"

"This one will feel different. Trust me."

The treasury vault was smaller than Cassian expected—a square chamber maybe twenty feet across, its walls lined with wooden shelves and locked cabinets. But the *value* of what it contained made his head swim. Even without touching the coin, he could feel the layers of worth: gold and jewels and rare artifacts, yes, but also the intangible weight of power, status, legitimacy. Every crown and scepter and ceremonial sword carried the accumulated authority of generations.

And beneath it all, pulsing like a drum, was the other coin.

"There," Cassian said, pointing to a corner cabinet.

Petras fumbled with his keys. The cabinet was locked three times over, protected by mechanisms that clicked and rattled as he worked them open. Inside were velvet-lined drawers, each containing carefully arranged treasures: rings set with enormous gemstones, golden chains thick as rope, ornate daggers in jeweled sheaths.

And in the bottom drawer, resting on a bed of black velvet, was the coin.

It was larger than Cassian's—almost twice the diameter—and its surface was etched with different symbols. Where his coin showed smooth black on one side and rough gold on the other, this one appeared to be bronze that had aged to green. But the moment Cassian's fingers brushed it, he felt the resonance.

The same unnatural weight. The same feverish warmth. The same sense of vast, patient power waiting to be used.

"That's it?" Mira asked, peering over his shoulder.

Cassian lifted the coin carefully. The moment it left the velvet, his own coin flared hot enough to burn. He gasped, nearly dropping both of them.

And then the presence in the Silent Market *surged*.

For the first time since inheriting his coin, Cassian felt the thing that dwelled in that gray space awaken fully. Not just watching now. *Active*. And it was interested in what he'd found.

*Ah,* it seemed to whisper directly into his mind. *The Coin of Seeds. Life, growth, and fertility. I wondered where this one had gone.*

"Cassian?" Mira's hand on his arm, steadying him. "What's wrong?"

"Nothing. I just—" He shook his head, trying to clear the ringing in his ears. "The two coins are resonating. It's like they recognize each other."

Petras was watching nervously. "Is it valuable? Should I note it in the inventory?"

"It's..." Cassian started to say "priceless," but stopped himself. To Petras, to the King, to anyone who couldn't feel what he felt, this was just an old bronze coin. Curious, perhaps. Historical. But not the fragment of divine power that it actually was. "It's interesting. I'd like to study it further. With the King's permission."

"I'll have to ask the chamberlain—"

"I'll handle that," Mira interjected smoothly. "You've been very helpful, Petras. We won't take up more of your time."

The clerk looked relieved to be dismissed. As soon as he was gone, Mira turned to Cassian. "So we just steal it?"

"We don't steal anything. I'm going to trade for it."

"Trade what? The King doesn't even know what he has."

"Which means he won't miss it if it's traded fairly." Cassian wrapped the Coin of Seeds in a cloth and slipped it into his coat. His own coin had settled to a steady, warm pulse—no longer burning, just... aware. "I'll offer something of equivalent value. Something personal."

"Cassian." Mira's voice was firm. "You need to stop trading away pieces of yourself. You're already missing your mother's face. You've lost memories of your childhood. How much more before there's nothing left?"

The reminder stung, but she wasn't wrong. Every trade took something. The question was whether what he gained was worth what he lost.

"I'll be careful," Cassian said. Though they both knew that was a promise he couldn't keep.

---

The King granted Cassian an audience that evening. They met in a small council chamber, private and quiet, with only the King's personal guard present.

"Lord Cassian," King Aldric said, gesturing to a chair. "My chamberlain tells me you've been exploring the treasury. Find anything interesting?"

"A coin," Cassian said simply. He didn't pull it out—not yet. "Bronze, aged to green, covered in unusual symbols. I believe it's... significant."

"Significant how?"

"It's similar to mine. Another fragment of the same power."

The King's expression sharpened. "You mean there are others? More people with your abilities?"

"Potentially. Though this one has been dormant for years, maybe decades. Whoever it belonged to is either dead or far from here."

"And you want it."

"I need it," Cassian corrected. "If I'm going to face Draven, if I'm going to stop what he's building, I need every advantage. He has one of these coins. I have one. This makes two."

"And what does it do? This second coin?"

Cassian hesitated. He didn't fully know. The impression he'd gotten from the presence in the Silent Market suggested it governed life, growth, fertility—but what that meant in practice, he couldn't say. "It's powerful. That's all I know for certain."

"Powerful." The King leaned back in his chair. "Let me tell you something about powerful artifacts, Cassian. My father collected them obsessively. Swords that supposedly never dulled. Crowns that granted authority. Rings that protected their wearers from poison. Do you know what all of them had in common?"

"They didn't work?"

"They worked exactly as well as the person wielding them believed they would. My father wore that crown for thirty years, convinced it made him a better king. It didn't. But the belief did." The King's eyes were hard. "I don't know if your coin is divine or delusional. But I do know that the man who saved Rothaven, who brokered the Covenant, who pulled my kingdom back from the edge—that man is worth more than any artifact."

Cassian felt something tighten in his chest. "Your Majesty—"

"I'm not finished." The King stood, pacing to the window. "I've been watching you, Cassian. Watching the trades you make. The prices you pay. You're destroying yourself, one piece at a time, and calling it heroism. If you take that second coin, how much more will you lose? How much more can you afford to lose?"

"As much as it takes."

"That's what I'm afraid of." The King turned. "I'll give you the coin. It's been sitting in that vault for forty years, doing nothing. If you can use it to stop the Hollow, then take it with my blessing. But I'm not accepting payment. No trade. No exchange. Consider it a gift."

Cassian's mind reeled. A gift? Just... given? No transaction, no balance, no cost? The coin in his pocket pulsed warm, as if agreeing, but everything Cassian had learned about the Law of Balance screamed that this was wrong. Dangerous. That accepting something without equivalent exchange would create debt, imbalance, consequences.

"I can't just take it," Cassian said. "The Law requires balance. If I accept without trade—"

"Then the debt falls on me." The King's smile was grim. "I'm a king, Cassian. I carry debts every day. The debt to my people. To my soldiers. To the dead who trusted me to keep their families safe. One more won't break me. But watching you hollow yourself out trying to pay for everything alone? That might."

"Your Majesty, you don't understand—"

"I understand that the coin has trained you to see everything through the lens of exchange. That's what it does—it shows you value, trade, balance. But sometimes a gift is just a gift." The King's voice softened. "Take the coin, Cassian. Use it. Stop Draven. And when this is over, if you still feel the need to balance the scales, then survive long enough to help rebuild what the Hollow has destroyed. That's payment enough."

Cassian stared at him. The trade was absurd. Impossible to quantify. How did you measure humanity? How did you value staying yourself against a physical artifact? The coin offered no guidance, no impressions, no abstract flashes of understanding. Just warmth against his ribs and silence from the presence that usually whispered in his mind.

And yet, the King was waiting. Patient. Sincere.

"I..." Cassian started, then stopped. Tried again. "Thank you."

"Don't thank me. Just don't waste it. Or yourself." The King gestured to the door. "Now get out. I have a kingdom to run and a war to plan. You have a week before the next council session. If you're going to figure out how to use that second coin, I suggest you start now."

---

Cassian left the council chamber in a daze, the Coin of Seeds heavy in his coat pocket, his own coin pulsing steadily in response. Mira was waiting in the corridor, leaning against a tapestry depicting some ancient battle.

"Well?" she asked.

"He gave it to me. No trade. Just... gave it."

She smiled. "Good. You need every advantage you can get."

"He said if I wanted to balance the scales later, I should survive long enough to help rebuild." Cassian shook his head. "Strange way to think about it."

"Not so strange. You saved Rothaven. You're trying to save the whole kingdom. Maybe he figures you've already paid in advance." Mira gestured toward his quarters. "Come on. You should test out how those two coins work together before the council meeting tomorrow."

"Test them how?"

"I don't know. That's your job to figure out." She gave him a look that was half concern, half exasperation. "Just... try not to trade away anything important while you're doing it, all right?"

---

That night, Cassian couldn't sleep. He sat by the window of his quarters, both coins laid out on the desk before him, watching them gleam in the candlelight.

The Coin of Heads—his coin—smooth and black on one side, rough and golden on the other. The symbols etched into the dark side seemed to shift when he wasn't looking directly at them.

The Coin of Seeds—bronze-green with age, its symbols entirely different but equally alive. Where his coin felt like possibility and perception, this one felt like *potential*. Like spring waiting to burst into summer.

He reached for both simultaneously.

The moment his fingers touched them, the Silent Market opened before him—not in meditation, but involuntarily, pulled open by the resonance between the two coins. And this time, it wasn't just the gray abstract space he was used to.

It was vast.

Stretching in every direction, the impressions of value formed a web so complex and interconnected that Cassian's mind could barely process it. Every person in the palace, every object, every memory and obligation and debt and gift—all of it visible at once, threads of exchange connecting everything to everything else.

And at the center of it all, watching him with patient interest, was the presence.

Except now Cassian could see it wasn't singular. It was two presences, intertwined. His coin and the new coin, both aware, both ancient, both curious about what he would do with them.

*You've found another,* the presence whispered—or both presences whispered together, their voices overlapping. *The Coin of Seeds. Growth and life and the patient unfolding of potential. It complements your Coin of Heads. Together, they could show you things neither could alone.*

"What things?" Cassian asked the vastness.

*How to restore what was taken. How to grow life from death, identity from emptiness. How to reverse what Draven has done.*

Cassian's breath caught. "You mean I could save them? The Hollow? Bring them back?"

*Perhaps. With mastery. With sacrifice. With proper understanding of both coins' natures.* A pause. *But you would have to learn to use both. Accept both. Bond with both. And the Coin of Seeds has no bearer. It is... dormant. Waiting.*

"Waiting for what?"

*For someone with unmet potential to wake it. Someone willing to accept its purpose.*

Cassian stared at the bronze-green coin. "Me? I already have one. Can a person even use two?"

*It has never been attempted. But these are not normal times. Draven possesses the Coin of Oxen and seeks the others. If he collects all seven, he will have power beyond comprehension. Perhaps the only counter is for someone else to master multiple coins. Perhaps that someone is you.*

"And the cost?"

A wave of something that might have been amusement rippled through the Silent Market. *The cost of bonding with the Coin of Seeds would be accepting its purpose. Growth. Nurturing. Patience. You would have to learn to let things develop at their own pace, rather than forcing outcomes through trade. You would have to cultivate rather than transact.*

"That's not a cost. That's just... philosophy."

*Is it? You're a man who's spent his life as a ledger-keeper, seeing numbers and balances. And you've been using the Coin of Heads for weeks now, which shows you value and exchange in everything. Learning to simply let things grow without measuring every variable, without calculating outcomes—that would require a different way of thinking entirely. Not less disciplined. Just... different.*

Cassian pulled his hands back from the coins, and the Silent Market collapsed back into normal vision. He was alone in his room again, candle burning low, night deep and quiet outside.

He turned the Coin of Seeds over in his palm, feeling its patient warmth. Growth. Cultivation. Patience. Everything the Coin of Heads wasn't.

Maybe that was the point. Maybe he needed both perspectives—the analytical precision of his coin, and the patient cultivation of this one. Not either-or, but both-and.

He picked up the Coin of Seeds and held it against his chest, feeling it pulse in rhythm with his heartbeat.

"All right," he whispered. "Show me how."

The coin's warmth spread through him—not a surge of power, but something gentler. Like the first warm day after a long winter. The promise of growth rather than growth itself.

*Patience,* the presence whispered. *All things in their season.*

Cassian sat back in his chair, both coins now warm against his skin. One in his pocket, one in his hand. Two fragments of an ancient crown, each with its own purpose, its own wisdom.

He didn't know yet how to use the Coin of Seeds. Didn't know what it would cost to bond with it fully, or what powers it would grant him. But he had time to learn.

For once, he had time.

Tomorrow, the council would meet. Plans would be made. The war against the Hollow would continue. But tonight, Cassian allowed himself to simply sit with the coins, feeling their different energies, beginning to understand how they might complement each other.

The Coin of Heads showed him what things were worth. The Coin of Seeds would teach him how to make things grow.

Together, they might be enough to counter what Draven had built.

Together, they might be enough to restore what the Hollow had taken.

And for the first time in weeks, when sleep finally came, Cassian didn't dream of debts or trades or empty spaces where memories used to be.

He dreamed of seeds growing in dark earth, patient and inevitable, waiting for their season. And in the dream, he understood: some things couldn't be traded for or bargained into being. Some things simply needed time, care, and the right conditions to grow.

It was a lesson he was only beginning to learn.

But it was a start.
