# Chapter 17: The Price of Rescue

Cassian ran north through the maze of alleys, his breath coming in ragged gasps. Behind him, whistles pierced the night—sharp, coordinated signals. The Society guards were organizing faster than he'd expected.

He ducked under a low archway, stumbled through a courtyard, vaulted a fence. The coins burned against his chest, their power fully restored but his body still battered. Five days of vitality spent on trades, combined with the beating from Veylin's interrogation, left him running on willpower alone.

A whistle sounded from directly ahead.

Cassian skidded to a stop, reversing direction. They were boxing him in, driving him like prey into a kill zone. He needed to think, to use the coins strategically rather than just running blind.

He pressed himself against a wall, entering the gray space. Through the coin's perception, he could sense the value patterns of the guards hunting him—their positions, their movements, the coordination of their search. At least a dozen, maybe more, spread across six blocks.

But he also sensed something else. To the west, toward the docks where Torin had fled—concentrated activity. Many guards converging. Had they caught him?

To the east, where Perin had gone—pursuit, but scattered. The guards there were searching but hadn't found their target yet.

And to the south, in the merchant quarter where Mira had disappeared—

Cassian's breath caught.

Too many guards. Far too many. And they weren't searching—they were stationary. Surrounding something. Or someone.

*Mira.*

He wanted to go to her, to help, but three guards rounded the corner directly in front of him. No time for subtlety.

Cassian pulled from the value of their alertness, draining just enough to make them sluggish. It cost him another day—six total now—but they stumbled, confused, as he sprinted past them.

He had to get to higher ground. Had to see what was happening.

A bell tower rose two blocks ahead—part of a small chapel. Cassian ran for it, pushed through the unlocked door, and climbed the narrow stairs. His legs screamed in protest. His vision blurred. But he kept climbing.

At the top, he emerged onto the bell platform and looked out over the city.

There—in the merchant quarter—torchlight. Dozens of torches, surrounding a narrow alley. He could see guards forming a perimeter, hear shouting even from this distance.

And then, cutting through the chaos like a blade, a new sound.

Horns. Royal horns.

From the north, a squadron of mounted soldiers appeared, wearing the King's colors. They rode hard through the streets, scattering civilians, heading straight for the merchant quarter.

*Aldric sent them,* Cassian realized. *He's intervening.*

Relief and dread warred in his chest. Relief that help had come. Dread at what it would cost the King politically.

The royal soldiers reached the merchant quarter and immediately engaged. Cassian could hear the captain's voice carrying across the distance: "By order of King Aldric, all personnel of the Merchant's Relief Society are under arrest!"

The Society guards hesitated, then some began to surrender. Others tried to run and were quickly overtaken by mounted soldiers. Within minutes, the situation was secured.

But was Mira there? Had they found her in time?

Cassian descended the bell tower stairs as fast as his battered body allowed. He needed to get to the merchant quarter, needed to see—

A hand grabbed his shoulder as he exited the chapel.

Cassian spun, coins raised defensively, but it was Torin—soaking wet, smelling of river water, his expression as flat as ever.

"Jumped," Torin said simply. "Docks. Water. Guards don't swim well."

Despite everything, Cassian almost laughed. "You're alive."

"For now." Torin's eyes focused on the distant torchlight. "Royal guards?"

"The King sent them. They're arresting the Society personnel."

"Mira?"

"I don't know." Cassian started moving toward the merchant quarter. "But I'm going to find out."

They ran together through the emptying streets. Citizens were retreating indoors, shuttering windows, trying to avoid whatever conflict was unfolding. Smart.

As they approached the merchant quarter, a royal guard stepped out to block their path—then recognized Cassian and immediately straightened.

"Master Cassian. Captain Drenneth is looking for you."

"Where is he?"

"Three blocks south. But sir, you should—"

Cassian was already moving.

He found Captain Drenneth in a narrow alley, supervising the binding of captured guards. The captain was in his fifties, grizzled and competent, wearing full armor despite the late hour.

"Master Cassian," Drenneth said, turning. "The King sent us to extract you and your companions. Are you injured?"

"I'm alive." Cassian scanned the alley desperately. "The others—Mira, Perin—did you find them?"

"We have search teams sweeping the district." Drenneth gestured to his soldiers. "Found one of your group already—the carpenter, Perin. He was cornered two streets over. We're bringing him here now."

"And Mira? The woman?"

Drenneth's expression tightened. "No sign yet. But we're still searching."

"She came this way. South, into the merchant quarter. I saw guards surrounding this area before you arrived."

"We found guards here, yes. But no prisoners when we secured the scene." Drenneth turned to one of his men. "Bring me that Society administrator. The one who tried to run."

A soldier dragged forward a man in gray robes—one of the handlers from the facility. His nose was broken, blood streaming down his face.

"Where's the woman?" Drenneth demanded. "The one your guards were pursuing in this district?"

The handler spat blood. "I don't know what you're talking about."

Cassian stepped forward, entering the gray space. He could see the lie written in the man's value patterns—the fear, the knowledge he was hiding.

"You're lying," Cassian said quietly. "And I can prove it."

He pulled gently from the value of the man's confidence, just enough to crack his resolve. The handler's eyes widened as he felt something shift inside him.

"Where is she?" Cassian repeated.

"I—" The handler's voice shook. "Administrator Veylin took her. Priority extraction protocol. Orders from the council."

Ice formed in Cassian's chest. "When?"

"Right after you escaped. Veylin got a message—said certain high-value prisoners were to be moved immediately if rescue was imminent." The handler was talking faster now, desperate to cooperate. "She took the woman and left through the back exit. I don't know where they went. I swear I don't know."

Cassian released him, and the man slumped in the soldier's grip.

"High-value prisoner," Drenneth said grimly. "Meaning she's worth more than just information."

"She can access the coins' power," Cassian said, his fragmented thoughts racing. "I showed her how, let her train with them. Draven wants to study it. Or use it. Or—"

He didn't finish. The implications were too terrible.

Torin spoke from behind him, voice flat: "Leverage. She's leverage against you."

"And bait," Cassian agreed. "He knows I'll come for her."

Drenneth's jaw tightened. "Master Cassian, my orders are to secure you and bring you to the palace. The King was explicit about that."

"I'm not leaving without her."

"You don't have a choice." Drenneth gestured, and two soldiers moved to flank Cassian—respectfully, but ready to enforce compliance if necessary. "The King risked significant political capital deploying us tonight. The least you can do is report to him before running headlong into another trap."

Cassian wanted to argue. Every instinct screamed at him to search, to chase, to find Mira before it was too late.

But Drenneth was right. He was exhausted, battered, operating at a fraction of his capacity. Rushing after Mira in his current state would help no one.

"The old mill," Cassian said quietly. "Outside the eastern gate. We were supposed to regroup there tomorrow night, two hours after sunset. If she escaped Veylin somehow, she'll go there."

"Then we'll have guards watching it," Drenneth promised. "If she shows, we'll secure her immediately." He softened slightly. "But Master Cassian, you need to accept the possibility that she's already in Draven's hands. And if that's true, going after her plays directly into his plans."

"I know." Cassian clutched the coins tighter. "But I'm going anyway."

"Not tonight, you're not." Drenneth gestured to a waiting wagon. "Tonight, you're coming to the palace. You're going to eat, rest, and report to the King. In that order. Then, if you still want to chase after her tomorrow, at least you'll have a chance of surviving."

Perin emerged from a side street, escorted by two royal guards. His face lit up with relief when he saw Cassian.

"You made it," Perin said. "I thought—when the guards cornered me, I thought we'd all been caught."

"The King sent help," Cassian said. "But Mira—"

"I know. I heard." Perin's expression darkened. "So what do we do?"

"First, you find Elena," Cassian said firmly. "Get her somewhere safe. That's your only priority."

"And then?"

"Then we figure out how to get Mira back."

Drenneth interrupted. "Into the wagon, both of you. We need to clear this area before more Society personnel arrive or the merchant's guild starts asking questions."

Cassian let himself be guided to the wagon. Torin climbed in silently beside him. Perin followed, moving like a man in a daze.

As the wagon pulled away from the merchant quarter, Cassian looked back at the scattered torchlight, the arrested guards, the chaos of the incomplete rescue.

They'd escaped. The King had intervened. But Mira was gone.

And somewhere in the distance, she was being delivered to Draven Kane.

---

The chamber was deep underground—Mira could tell by the chill in the air, the absolute silence, the sense of weight pressing down from above. The walls were carved from bedrock, lit by oil lamps that cast dancing shadows across ancient stone.

Administrator Veylin shoved her through the heavy iron door.

"Move," Veylin ordered, her voice cold and precise.

Mira stumbled forward, wrists bound behind her back. Her eye was still swollen from the earlier interrogation, her ribs aching from where a guard had struck her during the pursuit. She'd fought—taken down three of them before they'd overwhelmed her—but there had been too many.

And then Veylin had appeared with a message and that terrible, satisfied smile.

"Priority extraction," she'd said. "The council wants you delivered personally."

The chamber was circular, maybe twenty feet across. No windows. A single door—the one she'd just been pushed through. And in the center, sitting in a high-backed chair like it was a throne, was the man she'd met once before.

Draven Kane.

He looked a bit different from what she remembered, with dark hair silvering at the temples. Handsome in a severe way, like a scholar or a successful merchant. He wore fine clothes, well-tailored but not ostentatious. In the tent, he'd seemed almost ordinary, blending in with the handlers. Here, in this underground chamber, everything about him suggested power, refinement, control.

But his eyes were cold. Pale gray, calculating, weighing her like a merchant appraising goods.

And beneath his shirt, Mira could sense something. A presence. Power thrumming with a familiar rhythm.

Another coin.

"Mira," Draven said, his voice smooth and cultured. "Thank you for joining us. Please, sit."

He gestured to a chair facing his own. When Mira didn't move, Veylin shoved her toward it. Mira sat, more from exhaustion than compliance.

"The others?" Draven asked Veylin without looking away from Mira.

"Escaped. The King's guard arrived too quickly—we lost the facility and approximately thirty personnel to arrests." Veylin's jaw was tight with barely contained anger. "But we executed the extraction protocol as planned. This one was separated and secured before the royal forces could locate her."

"And Cassian has the coins back?"

"Yes. Both of them."

Draven smiled, and it was genuinely pleased. "Perfect."

Mira glared at him despite her exhaustion. "If this was your plan, it's a terrible one. Cassian will come for me."

"I'm counting on it." Draven leaned forward, studying her with the detached interest of a scholar examining a rare specimen. "Tell me, Mira. When Cassian saved your brother—partially, imperfectly—did you feel gratitude? Or guilt?"

Mira's stomach twisted, but she kept her voice level. "Go to hell."

"Guilt, I think," Draven continued as if she hadn't spoken. "Because Torin isn't really saved, is he? He's functional but damaged. A shadow of who he was. The brilliant mind reduced to mechanical cataloging. The warmth replaced by flat observation." His voice was almost gentle. "And you know Cassian could fix him. Fully restore him. But he hasn't. Have you ever wondered why?"

"Because it would cost too much," Mira said through gritted teeth. "The same reason you won't restore anyone. It's not worth it to you."

"Ah, but that's where you're wrong." Draven stood, walking slowly around her chair. "I don't restore people because I have a different vision. A better one. Universal order. True peace. A world where no one needs to become Hollow because I'll have the power to simply provide for everyone. But Cassian?" He paused behind her, his voice close to her ear. "He simply hasn't figured out how to restore the Hollow completely yet. Or more accurately, he hasn't been willing to pay the true price."

Mira's heart was pounding. She could feel the presence of Draven's coin now, so close. The power radiating from it made her skin crawl.

"What are you talking about?" she asked.

"The Coin of Seeds doesn't just grow plants, Mira. It grows anything. Life. Consciousness. Lost memories. The very essence of a person." Draven moved back into view, sitting on the edge of the table across from her. "With enough understanding, enough power, enough willingness to experiment, it could regrow your brother's missing pieces. Make him whole again. Restore not just his function but his soul."

Mira's breath caught. "You're lying."

"Am I? Ask yourself—why did the Coin of Seeds respond when Cassian tried to restore the Hollow? Why did it work at all, even partially?" Draven's pale eyes held hers. "Because the coin understands restoration. Growth. Renewal. It can accelerate the growth of anything that can grow—including the damaged pathways in a human mind. Cassian just doesn't fully understand its potential yet. Or perhaps he does, and he's afraid of what it would cost him."

"Even if that's true," Mira said, "he'd never help you."

"Help me? No, probably not." Draven smiled. "But you could help him. Cassian showed you how to access the coins' power, didn't he? Let you train with them. But he only taught you the basics. If you truly understood their potential, if you knew their secrets, you could restore Torin completely. Save your brother without asking Cassian to sacrifice anything more."

Mira's mind was racing. She had felt it—the connection to Cassian's power when he let her train with the coins. The strange resonance, the way the coins' energy seemed to flow through her when he was using them nearby. 

Cassian had taught her to perceive value, to sense the gray space. But he'd held back, kept her at the edges of true understanding.

What if there was more? What if he'd been protecting secrets she needed to save Torin?

"All I need," Draven continued, his voice reasonable and calm, "is for you to understand how that connection works. How to channel the power more deeply. And in exchange, I'll teach you what you need to know about the Coin of Seeds. How to use its restoration ability. How to accelerate growth not just in plants, but in living minds. How to make Torin whole."

"And what do you get out of it?" Mira demanded.

"Information. Understanding." Draven's smile widened. "You see, Mira, I'm collecting the coins. Cassian has two now—the Coin of Heads and the Coin of Seeds. I have my own coin." He said, placing a hand gently over the locket hanging from his neck. "But there are seven total, seven gems, scattered across the kingdoms."

He stood, walking to a shelf where something rested beneath a black cloth. He pulled the cloth away, revealing an object that made Mira's breath catch.

A crown. Ancient, tarnished silver, with seven empty settings arranged around its band. Even damaged and incomplete, it radiated power.

"The Crown of Aram," Draven said reverently. "Kings and conquerors have searched for it for centuries. I found it three years ago, buried in ruins older than the current kingdoms. And I've been collecting its fragments ever since."

He turned back to her. "When I reunite all seven coins with the crown and place it on my head, I'll command all the forces of nature. I'll have the power to reshape this broken world. To create true order. True peace. A world where no one starves, no one suffers, no one needs to trade away their humanity just to survive."

"You're insane," Mira breathed.

"Visionary," Draven corrected. "The difference is success. And I will succeed, Mira. With or without your cooperation. But if you help me understand how the connection works—how you access the coins' power when Cassian uses them—I'll teach you how to save your brother completely. A fair trade."

Mira wanted to spit in his face. Wanted to refuse categorically.

But the image rose unbidden in her mind—Torin, whole and healthy. Smiling. Laughing. The brilliant, warm brother she'd lost, restored completely. Not damaged. Not mechanical. Truly saved.

"I need to think about it," she said quietly.

"Of course. You have time." Draven nodded to Veylin. "Make sure our guest is comfortable. Food, water, a proper bed. This doesn't have to be unpleasant."

Veylin grabbed Mira's arm and pulled her toward a side door. As Mira was led away, Draven's voice followed her.

"Oh, and Mira? When Cassian comes for you—and he will—ask yourself this: Has he been completely honest with you about the coins' capabilities? Or has he been keeping secrets because he doesn't trust you enough to share them?"

The door closed behind her, and Mira was pushed into a small but comfortable room. A bed. A washbasin. A window—barred, but at least there was light.

Veylin cut the ropes binding her wrists. "Don't try anything stupid. There are guards outside, and this room is three levels underground. You're not escaping."

Then she left, and Mira was alone.

She sat on the bed, trembling. Not from fear. From the terrible, creeping doubt.

Could she really save Torin? Was Draven telling the truth?

And more importantly—had Cassian known this was possible and simply not told her?

Mira touched her wrist where she could still feel the faint echo of the coins' presence. Power, distant but present. Connected to Cassian somehow, to the coins, to possibilities she'd never imagined.

*What have I gotten myself into?* she thought.

But she already knew the answer.

Whatever it took to save Torin. Even if it meant making a deal with a monster.

---

King Aldric received Cassian in his private study rather than the throne room. It was past midnight, but the King was still fully dressed, pacing by the window when Cassian entered.

"You look terrible," Aldric said bluntly.

"I feel worse." Cassian slumped into a chair, the coins still burning in his palms. "Thank you for sending the guard. Without them, we'd all be captured or dead."

"And now my council is in an uproar." The King poured two glasses of wine, handing one to Cassian. "Half think I overstepped my authority by raiding a 'legitimate charitable organization.' The other half think I didn't go far enough. The merchant's guild is threatening to withdraw their financial support. And the Society is already spreading the narrative that you're a criminal who attacked innocent people."

Cassian took a sip of wine. It helped, slightly. "I'm sorry for the trouble."

"Don't be. I knew what I was doing." Aldric sat across from him. "We're at war, even if no one wants to call it that. Draven Kane is moving against us systematically, and we've been too worried about merchant politics and guild approval to fight back properly."

"We lost Mira," Cassian said quietly.

"I heard. Captain Drenneth is investigating, but the trail is cold. Whoever extracted her knew what they were doing." The King's expression was grim. "Do you know why Draven would take her specifically?"

"The blood bond." Cassian stared into his glass. "When I formed the bond with her to save Torin, it created a connection. She can access some of the coins' power—I don't fully understand how yet. But Draven must know about it. He wants to study it. Understand it. Maybe replicate it."

"Can he sever your bond to the coins? Take them for himself?"

"I don't know." Cassian looked down at the two coins in his free hand—the Coin of Heads and the Coin of Seeds. The Coin of Hands was back in his room, hidden. "The bond feels permanent, but I don't know its limits. If Draven has Mira, he has time to experiment. To test it. To find weaknesses."

The King was quiet for a long moment, his fingers drumming on the armrest. "What will you do?"

"Find her. Get her back."

"And if it's a trap?"

"It's definitely a trap." Cassian met the King's eyes. "But I'm going anyway."

"Then you're a fool."

"Probably." Cassian stood, wincing at the movement. "But she's one of mine. She risked everything to help me save her brother. I don't leave people behind."

King Aldric studied him for a long moment, his expression unreadable. Then he nodded slowly. "You'll need resources. Intelligence. Support."

"I'll need to rest first. And think clearly." Cassian tucked the coins away carefully. "But yes. When I'm ready, I'll need help."

"You'll have it," the King promised. "But Cassian—be smart about this. Draven is playing a longer game than either of us fully understands. He let you escape. He let you reclaim the coins. And now he has Mira. This is all part of some larger plan."

"I know." Cassian moved toward the door. "But I can't just abandon her."

"I'm not asking you to. I'm asking you to think strategically before you act." The King's voice was gentle but firm. "In war, sometimes you have to make impossible choices. Sacrifice one person to save hundreds. Let the enemy think they're winning while you position your real attack. This is how wars are won—by making hard decisions and living with the consequences."

Cassian paused at the door. "And what if I can save her and stop Draven? What if I don't have to choose?"

"Then you'll be a better man than me," Aldric said quietly. "But don't let hope blind you to reality. Draven wants you to come after her. Make sure when you do, you're walking into a trap on your terms, not his."

Cassian nodded and left the study.

The palace hallways were quiet, lit by oil lamps that cast long shadows. A servant showed him to a guest room—comfortable, with a proper bed and a washbasin. Perin had already been given a room nearby. Torin was somewhere else, being examined by the royal physician.

Cassian locked the door and collapsed onto the bed, every muscle aching.

Six days of his life spent on trades tonight. His body battered from interrogation and escape. His mind still fractured from holding the tethers. And Mira was in Draven's hands.

The coins burned against his chest, a constant reminder of power and cost.

*I will find you,* Cassian thought, directing the promise toward wherever Mira was. *I will get you back. Whatever it takes.*

But as exhaustion pulled him toward sleep, a darker thought surfaced.

What if the King was right? What if rescuing Mira was exactly what Draven wanted? What if she was bait for a trap so perfect that walking into it meant losing everything?

And what if Cassian was going to walk into it anyway, because leaving her behind would mean losing something worse than the coins, worse than his life?

Himself.

---

In her underground room, Mira lay awake on the bed, staring at the barred window.

Somewhere above, Cassian was free. Safe, probably. He had the coins back. The King's forces had rescued him.

But he would come for her. She knew him well enough to know that. He wouldn't leave her behind.

And when he did, Draven would be ready.

*I'm bait,* she realized. *The whole thing—the capture, the comfortable room, Draven's offer—it's all to draw Cassian in.*

But the terrible part was that Draven's offer was real. She could feel it in her bones. The blood bond did give her access to power. And if the Coin of Seeds could truly restore damaged minds...

Mira touched her wrist, feeling the faint echo of the coins' power in the distance.

*I could save Torin,* she thought. *Really save him. Make him whole.*

But at what cost? Teaching Draven how her connection to the coins worked? Helping him understand what Cassian had shown her?

She closed her eyes, trying to silence the temptation.

But Torin's face—mechanical, damaged, broken—rose in her mind. And beside it, the memory of who he'd been. Brilliant. Warm. Alive.

*What would I give to save him?* she wondered. *How far would I go?*

She didn't know the answer.

And that uncertainty terrified her more than Draven, more than imprisonment, more than any torture Veylin could devise.

Because it meant she might actually consider it.

Mira pulled the thin blanket over herself and tried to sleep.

But her dreams, when they came, were filled with choices she didn't want to make and prices she couldn't afford to pay.

---

The next morning, Cassian woke to sunlight streaming through the window and someone knocking on his door.

"Master Cassian?" A servant's voice. "The King requests your presence for breakfast."

Cassian sat up, every muscle protesting. The coins were still tucked safely in his shirt. Six days gone, but at least he was alive.

"I'll be right there," he said.

He washed quickly, changed into fresh clothes the palace had provided, and went downstairs to the King's private dining room.

King Aldric was already there, along with Captain Drenneth. They both looked exhausted.

"How did you find us?" Cassian asked as he sat. "How did you know where to send the guards?"

Drenneth answered. "Perin's daughter. Elena. She made it to the palace gates around dusk, demanding to see the King. Took three guards to calm her down enough to make sense of what she was saying."

"Elena told you where we were?"

"She saw which direction the Society guards took you after the capture," the King said. "Followed at a distance, saw them take you into the Relief Society facility. Then she ran here as fast as her legs could carry her." He shook his head with something like admiration. "Brave girl. Terrified, but she wouldn't leave until we promised to send help."

"Where is she now?" Cassian asked.

"Reunited with her father," Drenneth said. "First thing we did after bringing you all back was let them see each other."

Cassian felt a weight lift slightly. Elena was safe. Perin had his daughter back.

Small victories.

In the hallway, he leaned against the wall, closing his eyes.

Eight-year-old girls hiding in cellars. Families torn apart. People captured and converted. And Mira, somewhere in Draven's hands, facing temptations and tortures Cassian could only imagine.

This was the cost of fighting back. This was what resistance looked like.

And they were losing.

But Cassian clutched the coins tighter, feeling their heat, their power, their terrible promise.

*Not yet,* he thought. *We're not done yet.*

The game was just beginning.
