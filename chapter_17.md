# Chapter 16: Severance

The cell was cold stone and iron bars, ten feet square, smelling of rust and fear. No windows. A single torch in the hallway beyond cast shadows that crawled across the walls.

Cassian woke slowly, consciousness returning in fragments like broken glass being swept back together. His wrists were raw where ropes had been replaced with manacles. His shoulder throbbed where the club had struck. But worse than the physical pain was the hollowness in his chest—an ache that had nothing to do with the tethers he'd held and everything to do with what was missing.

The coins were gone.

He could still feel them, distantly. Like phantom limbs. The Coin of Heads pulsed somewhere to the north—perhaps a hundred yards away, held in some secure location. The Coin of Seeds hummed with muted energy in the same direction. The bonds weren't severed, but they were stretched thin, barely holding.

*How much power do I have without them?* The thought surfaced through his fragmented awareness. *Can I still access the gray space? Can I still negotiate?*

He tried to enter the Silent Market—that space between spaces where value became visible. His awareness shifted, but only partially. The gray space flickered around him, unstable and incomplete. He could perceive threads of value in the iron bars, sense the worth of the torch flame, but everything was muted. Distant. Like trying to see through fog.

*I can still access it,* he realized with a mixture of relief and dread. *But barely. Without the coins in my possession, I'm operating at maybe ten percent capacity.*

"You're awake." Mira's voice, rough and tired, came from the adjacent cell. Iron bars separated them. She sat against the far wall, one eye swollen shut, dried blood crusted on her lip. "Took you long enough."

"How long have I been unconscious?"

"Three hours. Maybe four." She shifted, chains clinking. "Perin woke up an hour ago. Torin hasn't moved since they threw him in."

Cassian looked across the hallway. Two more cells faced his. Perin sat in one, his head in his hands, shoulders shaking with silent sobs. In the other, Torin lay motionless on the stone floor, eyes open but unseeing—retreated so far into his damaged consciousness that he might as well be hollow again.

"They took the coins," Cassian said quietly.

"I know. I watched them wrap them in leather like they were handling live snakes." Mira touched her swollen eye gingerly. "The guard who tried to grab the coin directly? His hand blistered so badly they had to wrap it in wet cloth. Whatever bond you have with those things, it doesn't break easily."

"But it can be broken." Cassian closed his eyes, feeling the distant pulse of both coins. "If they study them long enough. Figure out how to sever the connection forcefully."

"Then what? They bond to someone else?"

"Maybe. Or they become inert. Or..." Cassian trailed off, not wanting to voice the darker possibilities. What happened when their bond was forcibly severed? Would the backlash destroy him? Would it destroy whoever tried to take them?

Footsteps echoed in the hallway.

Two guards appeared, flanking a woman in gray robes. She carried a leather satchel and moved with the precise confidence of someone who knew she was perfectly safe.

"Cassian." Her voice was cold, clinical. "I'm Administrator Veylin. I oversee security operations for the Merchant's Relief Society. We have questions."

She gestured, and the guards unlocked his cell door, stepping inside with clubs ready. Cassian didn't resist as they hauled him upright, manacles clinking. His legs barely supported his weight.

"Where are the other converts you freed?" Veylin asked without preamble. "The eight who escaped. Where would they go?"

Cassian said nothing.

"We've already recaptured three of them," she continued conversationally. "Found hiding in grain cellars and under market stalls. We're working on convincing them to return to the network. The process is quite unpleasant when they resist—we have methods."

Cassian's stomach turned, but he kept his face neutral.

"The other five are still out there. Damaged. Terrified. Alone." Veylin stepped closer. "You freed them, but you can't protect them. They'll be caught within days—maybe hours. But if you tell us where they're likely hiding, we can make the process of bringing them back more... efficient."

"Why would you do that?"

"Because damaged converts are less useful." She spoke like she was discussing crop yields. "A convert who resists and must be broken takes weeks to become functional again. But one who agrees to return? Immediate integration. It's simply better business."

"You're not getting anything from me."

Veylin sighed. "I expected as much. Still, I had to try the reasonable approach first." She nodded to the guards. "Proceed."

One guard grabbed Cassian's manacled wrists and yanked them upward, forcing him to his knees. The other drew a thin metal rod from his belt—not a club, but something designed for precision pain.

"Let's start with something simple," Veylin said. "Your accomplice. The girl in the next cell. How long have you known her?"

Cassian gritted his teeth. "Go to hell."

The rod struck his ribs—not hard enough to break bone, but precise enough to light every nerve ending on fire. He gasped, vision blurring.

"How long have you known her?" Veylin repeated.

"Weeks. I don't... I don't know exactly."

"And where did you meet?"

Another strike. Higher this time, just below the shoulder. Cassian's mind tried to retreat into the gray space, seeking refuge, but without the coins in hand he couldn't fully enter. He was trapped in his body, feeling everything.

"Where did you meet?" Veylin asked again, her tone unchanged.

From the adjacent cell, Mira's voice rang out: "Leave him alone, you bitch!"

Veylin barely glanced at her. "I'll get to you next. Patience."

The interrogation continued. Questions about safe houses, contacts in the city, other members of the Unhollow. Cassian answered when he could without endangering anyone, stayed silent when he couldn't, and took the punishment for both.

The metal rod found his kidneys. His shoulders. The backs of his knees. Each strike was carefully measured—enough pain to motivate answers, not enough damage to render him unconscious. Veylin was practiced at this.

After what felt like hours, she finally stepped back. "Enough for now. We'll resume in the morning when you've had time to reconsider cooperation."

The guards shoved Cassian back against the wall and left, locking the cell behind them. Veylin paused at the door.

"One more thing," she said. "The coins. We're studying them in research wing. Our specialists are trying to understand the bond. If you'd like to avoid the rather unpleasant experience of having that bond tested, I suggest you become more forthcoming in our next session."

She left.

Cassian lay on the cold stone, every muscle aching. His fragmented thoughts tried to process what he'd learned. The coins were in the north wing. Studied by specialists.

"Cassian?" Mira's voice, quieter now. "You alive?"

"Barely."

"They'll come for the rest of us next. Try to get information about who else might be helping you."

"I know."

"I won't tell them anything."

"I know that too." Cassian shifted, trying to find a position that didn't make everything hurt worse. "But you don't have to take their torture. If they ask something that won't endanger anyone, just answer. Save yourself the pain."

"Same logic applies to you."

"I can't. I know too much." He closed his eyes. "I know where the safe houses are. Who's helping. Where Elena is hiding."

The name hung in the air. Perin's daughter. The eight-year-old girl who'd watched them all get captured.

From across the hall, Perin's voice emerged, broken and raw: "She saw it happen. She was supposed to stay hidden, but she followed us. She saw everything."

"She's smart," Cassian said. "She'll find help. She knows where the safe houses are—"

"She's eight years old!" Perin's shout echoed off the stone walls. "She watched them drag her father away in chains. Again. After everything—after you saved me, after I thought we were finally safe, after she finally stopped having nightmares—" His voice broke. "She was supposed to stay hidden. She promised me. But she followed anyway because she wanted to see her papa be brave."

The silence that followed was suffocating.

"We freed eight people," Mira said finally, but her voice was hollow. "Maybe more, if the eleven damaged ones can rebuild themselves."

"And how many got recaptured?" Perin's laugh was bitter. "How many died? I saw that woman's head hit the stone. She wasn't moving after."

"We did what we could."

"We got ourselves captured and handed Draven two more weapons!" Perin shouted, chains rattling as he stood. "We gave him exactly what he wanted while accomplishing nothing!"

Silence fell, heavy and damning.

Because Perin was right. They'd freed a handful of people at the cost of losing the coins and getting captured. Draven was stronger now, and they were locked in cells, broken and helpless.

Cassian tried to access the gray space again, searching for any thread he could pull, any value he could trade. The space flickered around him, unstable. He could perceive the iron bars—worth perhaps two silver coins for the metal. The torch flame—worth the oil that fed it. The stone walls—worth the labor that had shaped them.

But without the coins in hand, he couldn't make significant trades. Couldn't negotiate with the Law. Couldn't bargain for their freedom.

*Unless...*

The thought surfaced slowly, like something rising from deep water.

The coins were still bonded to him. Still connected. The link was stretched thin, but it existed. Which meant they were still *his* in the eyes of the Law, even if he didn't physically possess them.

What if he could use them remotely?

Cassian focused on the distant pulse of the Coin of Heads. He reached out through the bond, trying to extend his awareness along that thread of connection. The effort was like trying to lift a boulder with frayed rope—the link kept slipping, his focus fragmenting.

But after several minutes of intense concentration, something shifted.

His perspective lurched sideways, and suddenly he was seeing through different eyes.

A laboratory. Well-lit by multiple lanterns. Tables covered with instruments—scales, calipers, hammers, chisels. And in the center, on a cushion of black velvet, lay both coins.

The room was empty. No guards. No researchers. Just the coins, resting in the quiet.

Cassian's awareness stabilized, anchoring to the Coin of Heads' perspective. He could see the room, hear the sounds, perceive the value in everything around him. But it was like watching through a thick window—he could observe but not truly interact. Not from this distance.

The laboratory was full of valuable equipment. Research notes scattered across desks. And his coins, waiting.

*If I can just get there,* he thought. *If I can reach them physically, I'll have my full power back.*

But that was the problem. The cell bars were too strong. The guards too numerous. And Veylin would be back in the morning with her questions and her metal rod.

His awareness snapped back to his body with nauseating abruptness. The cell solidified around him. The pain returned in full force.

"You all right?" Mira asked. "You were gone for a minute there. Staring at nothing."

"I can still reach them," Cassian said quietly. "The coins. I can see through their perspective. But I can't use them properly. Not from this distance, not with the bond stretched so thin."

"So we're stuck."

"For now." Cassian shifted carefully, testing which parts of his body hurt least. "The coins are in the north wing."

"Can you reach them from here?"

"Barely. I can observe through them, but using their power remotely is costly. Inefficient." He opened his eyes. "But if I could get closer, get them back in my possession..."

"That's insane. You can barely stand."

"I know." Cassian opened his eyes, looking at her through the bars. "But I don't see another option. Veylin will be back tomorrow. She'll escalate the interrogation. Eventually, I'll break or she'll kill me trying. Either way, we lose."

"What about the King? Won't he try to rescue us?"

"Maybe. But if he does, it'll be a political nightmare. The Relief Society will claim we committed crimes, that the King is overreaching, that he's protecting criminals." Cassian shook his head. "And even if he tries, Draven will have contingencies. We can't count on rescue."

From across the hall, Torin finally stirred. His voice emerged, flat and distant: "The building layout. Three floors. We're on the ground level. North wing is second floor. Two staircases. Guard rotation every three hours."

Everyone turned to look at him. Torin hadn't spoken since they'd been captured.

"You've been listening?" Mira asked.

"Always listening." Torin sat up slowly, movements mechanical. "The guards talk. They don't think prisoners can understand. But I catalog everything. Guard schedules. Room locations. Door positions." His eyes focused on Cassian. "It's easier than feeling. You want to reach the north wing. But you can't access your coins' full power from this distance, and you can't walk through walls."

"I know."

"So you need to get closer." Torin stood, chains clinking. "Close enough that the bond strengthens. Close enough to actually use them."

"Which means escaping these cells first. Which I can't do without the coins." Cassian laughed bitterly. "It's circular logic. A trap."

"Not if you change the terms." Torin moved to the bars, gripping them with both hands. "You've been thinking like a prisoner. Bars. Guards. Locked doors. All obstacles."

"They are obstacles."

"They're also value." Torin's expression didn't change, but something shifted in his tone. "Everything is value. You taught me that. The iron in these bars—worth something. The guards' time—worth something. The very fact that we're imprisoned—worth something to Draven."

Cassian felt understanding bloom slowly. "I can't make big trades from here. But I can make small ones."

"Very small ones," Torin agreed. "Precise ones. The kind that look like nothing but change everything."

Mira leaned forward. "What are you two talking about?"

"The Law of Balance doesn't require possession," Cassian said slowly, his fragmented thoughts suddenly crystallizing. "It requires connection. I'm still bonded to the coins, which means I can still negotiate. Just... smaller. More carefully."

He closed his eyes again, reaching for the distant pulse of the Coin of Heads. This time he didn't try to use its power. He just asked a question.

*What is the value of this iron bar?*

The answer came back, faint but clear: *Two silver coins in raw material. Three silver for forged work. But currently holding four prisoners—value to Draven approximately twenty gold coins each, total eighty gold.*

*And what if the value of imprisonment decreased?*

The Law considered. *The value of imprisonment is measured by security. Reduce security, reduce value.*

Cassian opened his eyes. "The hinges. On these cell doors. They're old iron, poorly maintained. If I could trade away a tiny fraction of their structural integrity—make them just slightly weaker—"

"They'd still hold," Mira finished. "But one good kick might break them."

"Except I can't kick hard enough from this condition." Cassian gestured to his battered body. "Not without help."

All eyes turned to Perin. The carpenter sat slumped in his cell, but his shoulders were still broad. His arms still carried the strength of years hauling timber and swinging hammers.

"You want me to kick down the door?" Perin asked incredulously.

"After I weaken the hinges, yes."

"And then what? We fight our way through dozens of guards?"

"No." Cassian's mind was working faster now, pieces falling into place. "We create a distraction. Make them think we're trying to escape through the front entrance. While they're focused there, we slip up to the north wing, I grab the coins, and we leave through a window."

"That's the plan? That's your brilliant escape strategy?"

"It's insane," Mira agreed.

"It's also our only option," Torin said flatly. "Morning comes in five hours. Veylin returns. Interrogation escalates. Within two days, they'll have extracted everything useful and we'll either be killed or converted." His damaged expression somehow managed to convey certainty. "We try this now or we don't try at all."

Perin was quiet for a long moment. Then he stood, moving to his cell door. "Fine. Let's be insane together. Better than sitting here waiting to die."

Cassian felt a surge of gratitude. "Thank you."

"Thank me when we're not captured anymore." Perin tested the door, pushing experimentally. "So how do we get out?"

Cassian was quiet, thinking. "The mortar," he said slowly. "Between the stones around your door frame. It's old. Crumbling."

"So?"

"So there are cracks. And in cracks, things grow." Cassian reached for the Coin of Seeds through the distant bond. "Moss. Lichen. Maybe seeds blown in from outside, dormant in the dirt. I can feel them—tiny, waiting."

Torin understood first. "You can make them grow."

"Fast enough to break the mortar. The door frame will lose its anchor. Then Perin can pull it free."

"That's insane," Mira said.

"Everything about this is insane." Cassian closed his eyes, entering the gray space. He could perceive the tiny sparks of life around Perin's door—seeds so small they were almost nothing. Waiting for spring that would never come in this dark hallway. But with enough growth energy...

He spoke to the Law: "I offer this trade. Four days of my vitality, transferred to accelerate the growth of dormant seeds and roots around this door frame. Fair exchange for rapid growth."

The Law considered. Vitality for growth—within the Coin of Seeds' domain. The scope was small, localized to one door frame. Even remotely, this was possible.

The Law accepted.

Cassian felt four days of his life flow out through the distant bond. Around Perin's cell door, something stirred.

Roots erupted from the mortar cracks. Not huge—these were tiny seeds, weeds and moss—but growing with such explosive force that they cracked the stone. Mortar crumbled. Dust fell. The iron brackets holding the door frame to the wall began to shift, pushed out by the expanding plant matter.

"Now," Cassian gasped. "Pull it."

Perin grabbed the door and yanked. The frame came partially free from the wall—not completely, but enough. The door twisted, the lock no longer aligned. He could squeeze through the gap.

Perin pushed through, then used his strength to widen the gap further. "Give me the keys to the manacles first. I can't reach yours through the bars if my hands are still chained."

Cassian focused on the guard station down the hall. Two guards, keys hanging on hooks. But he was too weak, too distant from the coins. He couldn't make them come.

"We'll have to take them," Cassian said. "Quietly."

Perin nodded and moved silently down the hallway, pressing against the wall. Cassian watched through the gray space as Perin approached the guard station. The carpenter moved with surprising stealth, using shadows, waiting for both guards to look away.

One guard stood to stretch. Perin moved—fast, brutal, efficient. An arm around the throat, pressure on the carotid. The guard went limp in seconds. The second guard turned, opening his mouth, but Perin was already there. A knee to the gut, an elbow to the temple. Both guards down before either could shout.

Perin grabbed the keys and ran back, unlocking first Mira's cell, then Torin's, then Cassian's. Within moments all four stood free, manacles removed.

"The north wing," Mira said. "Get your coins and get out."

They moved quickly down the hallway, trying to stay quiet. Torin led them—his cataloging mind providing navigation. Every turn, every stairwell mapped from overheard conversations.

Up the stairs to the second floor. Cassian's breathing was labored, each step harder than the last. The trades had cost him. Four days for the key. Two days for the guard. His vitality was draining.

"North wing is this way," Torin whispered. "Last door on the left."

They turned the corner into the north hallway and froze.

Four guards stood at the far end, clustered around a doorway. The laboratory door.

"They're watching it," Mira breathed. "They knew—"

"No," Torin said. "Standard night watch. They rotate two guards to the research wing. I heard them discussing the schedule."

"Four guards, not two," Perin said.

"They increased security. After what happened at the warehouse." Torin's voice remained flat. "Logical precaution."

Behind them, a shout echoed from the first floor. Someone had found the unconscious guards at the guard station.

"We're trapped," Mira said. "Guards behind, guards ahead."

Cassian's mind raced, but thinking was hard. The fragmentation, the vitality drain, everything was making it difficult to focus. Four guards ahead. More coming from behind. And he was barely standing.

"I can't fight four guards," he said quietly. "Not remotely. Not in this condition."

"Then we fight them the old-fashioned way." Perin hefted his piece of wood. "It's four against four."

"You'll die," Cassian said. "They have swords. We have desperation and a broken chair leg."

The boots were getting closer. They had maybe thirty seconds before guards reached the second floor.

"Window," Torin said, pointing to a narrow window in the hallway. "Fire escape on the exterior wall. Leads to the roof."

"And then what?" Mira demanded.

"Then we improvise." Cassian stumbled to the window, fumbling with the latch. His hands were shaking. Behind them, guards were shouting, organizing, climbing the stairs.

The window opened. Cold air rushed in. Outside, an iron fire ladder clung to the brick wall, leading up.

"Go!" Cassian pushed Mira through first. Then Torin. Then Perin.

He pulled himself through just as guards rounded the corner. One of them shouted and pointed.

Cassian climbed, arms burning, legs barely responding. Up to the roof. The others were already there, pulling him over the edge.

The roof was flat tar and gravel, surrounded by a low wall. Three stories up. And on the far side—

"The laboratory window," Torin said, pointing. "Third window from the corner. That's where your coins are."

The laboratory was on the second floor, but its north window faced a different section of roof—a lower level, maybe ten feet down from where they stood.

"We can jump to that roof section," Mira said. "Then break the window and—"

Heads appeared at the fire escape. Guards climbing up.

"No time for discussion." Cassian ran for the edge and jumped.

For a terrifying moment, he was airborne. Then he hit the lower roof hard, rolling, pain shooting through his already battered body. The others landed around him—Mira graceful, Torin mechanical, Perin with a pained grunt.

The laboratory window was right there. Cassian could see the coins inside, resting on their cushion.

He grabbed a loose brick from the roof's edge and hurled it through the glass.

Cassian dove through the broken window, glass shards catching his clothes, tearing skin. He hit the laboratory floor hard, rolled, and came up reaching.

There—on the black velvet cushion—both coins.

His fingers closed around them.

The moment his fingers touched the Coin of Heads, power flooded back like a dam breaking. The bond snapped taut, fully reconnected, and suddenly he was complete again. The gray space opened around him in full clarity. Value threads blazed throughout the room.

He grabbed the Coin of Seeds with his other hand, and growth energy surged through his battered body. Not healing—he didn't have time for that—but strength. Vitality. The promise that he could keep moving, keep fighting.

The fragmentation in his mind began to clear. Not completely—the damage from holding twenty-seven tethers would take time to fully heal—but enough. He could think again. Plan. Act.

"Finally," he breathed.

The laboratory door burst open. Six guards poured through, weapons drawn.

And Cassian smiled.

Now he had options.

Cassian turned, both coins burning in his palms. Six guards filled the doorway, clubs and swords drawn. He entered the gray space fully, seeing them as bundles of value—their strength, their will, their consciousness.

Now that the coins were back in his possession, his mind felt sharper. Clearer. The fragmentation from holding the tethers was still there, but muted. He could think again.

He scanned the room rapidly. Tables full of instruments. Scales, calipers, measuring devices—all valuable. Glass vials filled with reagents. And there, on the corner desk, a leather pouch. Money. Research funding.

Cassian reached into the gray space and grasped the value of the coins in that pouch—approximately thirty gold pieces, he sensed. Enough to pay a craftsman for months. Enough to compensate six guards for letting prisoners escape.

"I offer this trade," he said quickly. "The gold in that pouch goes to these six guards, divided equally. In exchange, they step aside and let us leave."

The Law considered. Five gold coins per guard to allow four prisoners to escape? Fair compensation. The guards were being paid to stop them, but this was better pay than their employers offered.

The Law accepted.

All six guards felt the transaction complete in their minds. The leather pouch on the desk now contained their payment—five gold coins each, legally theirs through the Law's recognition. They were no longer being paid to stop the escape. They'd been paid to allow it.

Five of the six immediately stepped aside, looking somewhat dazed but satisfied with the unexpected windfall.

The sixth—a woman with fierce eyes and a scar across her chin—shook her head. "I don't want your blood money. You're not leaving."

Cassian respected that. "Then I'm sorry."

He pulled from the value of her wakefulness—a small theft, quick and precise. The woman's eyes rolled back and she collapsed, unconscious.

It cost him only one day now. With the coins back in his hands, trades were efficient again. Clean. Precise.

Mira, Torin, and Perin climbed through the broken window from the roof, joining Cassian in the laboratory. The five bribed guards were already heading for the door, eager to collect their payment and disappear before questions were asked.

"Window!" Mira pointed to a different window—the one facing the alley. "We need to move before more guards come!"

They ran to it. Cassian looked down. Twenty feet to the alley below. Cobblestones. A potentially deadly drop.

Shouts echoed from the hallway. More guards coming.

"Wait," he said, his mind working quickly. The coins were back in his hands. He could think clearly again, see solutions.

He turned back to the laboratory, scanning the tables. Glass vials. Reagents. Scales. And there—bundles of dried herbs hanging from the ceiling. Medicinal plants, valuable for their healing properties.

But among them, he could sense something more useful. Seeds. Herb seeds stored in small cloth pouches for planting in the spring.

Cassian grabbed three pouches from the shelf, feeling their contents through the gray space. Hearty climbing vines. Fast-growing ground cover. Perfect.

"What are you doing?" Mira hissed.

"Something we'd better hope will work." Cassian opened the pouches and scattered the seeds out the window, letting them fall to the alley below. Then he held up the Coin of Seeds.

He spoke to the Law: "I offer this trade. The value of those expensive laboratory instruments on the center table—transferred to accelerate the growth of these seeds. Fair exchange for rapid growth."

The Law considered. Laboratory equipment for accelerated plant growth? The values were roughly equivalent. The exchange was clean.

The Law accepted.

The instruments on the table tarnished, aged, became brittle—their value drained. And in the alley below, the scattered seeds erupted into life.

Vines shot upward at impossible speed, thick woody stems reaching for the window. Within seconds, a lattice of vegetation covered the wall—cushioning, climbing holds, a living ladder.

And it had cost Cassian nothing but stolen property.

"Down!" he called. "Quickly!"

They descended—Torin first, moving mechanically but efficiently. Then Mira, then Perin. Cassian came last, feeling stronger than he had minutes ago, his mind clearer with the coins back in his possession.

The vines held.

The four climbers reached the ground as shouts erupted from the window above.

Cassian's feet hit solid ground. The coins burned in his grip, still connected, still his. And he'd escaped without trading away more of his own life—just stolen property and laboratory equipment.

Small victories.

"Move!" Mira dragged him upright. "They'll be right behind us!"

They ran into the maze of alleys, leaving the Merchant's Relief Society facility behind. Cassian could hear shouting. Boots on cobblestones. But they had a head start.

"Where do we go?" Perin gasped as they rounded a corner.

"Split up," Cassian said. His mind was working again, sharp and clear despite the physical exhaustion. "They'll be looking for a group of four. Alone, we can disappear."

"And regroup where?" Mira demanded.

"The old mill outside the eastern gate. Tomorrow night, two hours after sunset." Cassian grabbed Perin's shoulder, looking him in the eye. "And you go to Elena. Get her somewhere safe. That's your only job. Forget the Unhollow. Forget the resistance. Keep your daughter alive."

Perin's face twisted with emotion. "But—"

"That's an order." Cassian released him. "The rest of us will handle the next steps. You protect her. Understood?"

After a moment, Perin nodded. "Understood."

"If anyone doesn't make it to the mill," Cassian continued, "we wait one more night. After that, we assume capture or worse."

They all nodded.

They reached an intersection and scattered—Mira disappearing south into the merchant quarter where she knew every alley, Perin east toward where Elena was hiding, Torin west toward the docks. 

Cassian stumbled north, clutching both coins, feeling them pulse with heat against his chest.

He'd reclaimed his power. They'd escaped. But the cost was adding up—six days of his life spent in trades tonight. Not catastrophic, but not nothing either.

And Perin was right. They hadn't accomplished anything. Eight people were still in the Hollow's hands. The Society now knew his capabilities. And somewhere, an eight-year-old girl was hiding alone, traumatized by watching her father dragged away in chains.

Behind him, more shouts. More boots. The hunt was on.

Cassian ran, vanishing into the shadows. His next move was already forming in his mind.

He'd lost this round. But the game wasn't over.

Not yet.
