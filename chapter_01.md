# Chapter 1: Inheritance

The ledger didn't lie.

Cassian ran his finger down the column of numbers a third time, though he already knew what he'd find. The tax assessment for Southgate district—where widow Marta struggled to feed her children, where old Breven the cooper was one bad season from losing his shop—was precisely seventeen percent higher than the charter allowed. Meanwhile, Magistrate Torven's own holdings in the merchant quarter were recorded at half their actual value.

The discrepancy wasn't subtle. It was brazen.

Cassian sat back in his chair, the wood creaking in the silence of the counting house. Through the window, he could see the afternoon sun slanting across the market square, painting long shadows across the cobblestones. In a few hours, he would bury his father. He should be home, preparing. Washing, dressing, pretending he had the money to feed mourners who wouldn't come.

Instead, he was staring at numbers that would make him enemies.

His hand moved toward his pen, then stopped. The ledger lay open before him, damning in its precision. He could close it. File it away. Pretend he'd never seen the discrepancy. Torven had been magistrate for fifteen years—clearly no one else had noticed, or if they had, they'd known better than to cross him.

Cassian's father had spent his life chasing rumors no one cared about. It had cost him his fortune, his reputation, his sanity. And what had it earned him? A pauper's funeral and a son who resented him for it.

*Don't be like him,* Cassian thought. *Don't throw your life away for numbers in a book.*

But then he thought of Marta's face when she'd come to pay her tax last month. The careful way she'd counted out the coins, her fingers trembling slightly with exhaustion or cold or fear—he hadn't been able to tell which. How she'd apologized for asking if the amount was correct, as if questioning the town's assessment was a sin worthy of penance.

She'd been right to question it. She'd been overcharged by more than two silver crowns. Enough to feed her children for a week.

The law was clear. The town charter, written two hundred years ago when Millhaven was founded, specified tax rates down to the copper. Cassian's job as ledger-keeper was to maintain accuracy, to ensure the numbers reflected reality. Not the story Torven preferred, but the truth.

His father's voice echoed in memory: *Some things are worth pursuing even if the world calls you a fool for it.*

Cassian picked up his pen. His hand was steadier than he'd expected.

The corrections took forty minutes. Each entry required careful notation—the original assessment, the charter-specified rate, the difference, his signature attesting to the accuracy of the amendment. His script grew tighter as the afternoon waned, his hand cramping from the precise work. Through the window, he watched the market square empty as merchants closed their stalls. The sun dropped lower, throwing the counting house into shadow.

When he finished the last entry, he sat back and flexed his aching fingers. The ink was still drying, dark against the cream-colored parchment. There it was: proof of fraud, written in his own hand.

He could still burn it. Start fresh tomorrow, let the discrepancy disappear into the comfortable fog of "that's how it's always been done."

But Marta would still be paying seventeen percent beyond what the law required. Breven would still be one bad season from losing his shop. And Cassian would still have to look at himself in the mirror.

He closed the ledger, wrapped it carefully, and stood. His legs felt unsteady—not from fear, he told himself, but from sitting too long.

The walk to the town clerk's office took five minutes. The evening air was cool against his face, carrying the smell of baking bread from the corner bakery and smoke from dinner fires. People nodded to him as he passed—they knew about the funeral, about his father.

The clerk's office was a small room off the main hall of the municipal building. Clerk Hennis looked up from his desk when Cassian entered, his expression shifting from bored to surprised.

"Cassian. I thought you'd be—"

"I need to file an amended assessment." Cassian set the ledger on the desk before he could change his mind. "Corrections to the Southgate and merchant quarter tax records."

Hennis opened the ledger. His eyebrows rose as he scanned the entries. "These are... Cassian, are you certain about this?"

"The charter rates are public record. You can verify them yourself."

"It's not the accuracy I'm questioning." Hennis lowered his voice. "The magistrate won't—"

"The magistrate will follow the law," Cassian said, though his mouth had gone dry. "File it, please."

Hennis held his gaze for a long moment, then nodded slowly. He signed the registry, dated the entry, and placed the ledger in the official filing cabinet. The lock clicked shut with a sound like a prison door closing.

"May the light guide you," Hennis said quietly.

Cassian walked back to the counting house feeling simultaneously lighter and heavier than before. There was no undoing it now. The law would be followed, or he would discover exactly how much "the law" meant when it inconvenienced powerful men.

He'd barely sat down at his desk when Torven stormed through the door.

"You insolent whelp!" Torven's face had gone the color of raw meat. "Do you have any idea what you've done?"

Cassian stood, keeping his hands steady on the desk. "I've corrected an error in the tax records, Magistrate. As my position requires."

"An *error*?" Torven leaned across the desk, and Cassian caught the smell of wine on his breath. "You've accused me of—"

"I've accused no one of anything," Cassian interrupted, his voice calm. "The numbers speak for themselves. The charter is public record. Anyone can verify the correct rates."

"The charter is two centuries old! The assessments have always been done by—"

"By the law." Cassian met his gaze. "Which I'm bound to uphold."

Torven's jaw worked silently for a moment. Then he straightened, smoothing his robe. When he spoke again, his voice was ice. "Your quarterly bonus has been revoked. And I'll be recommending to the council that we... reevaluate the necessity of a dedicated ledger-keeper position. Many towns manage with far less oversight."

"As you see fit, Magistrate."

"Your father's funeral is today, isn't it?" Torven's smile was thin. "I suppose you won't be expecting many mourners. Madness runs in families, they say."

He left before Cassian could respond.

---

The graveyard stood on a hill east of town, where the autumn wind swept across rows of weathered headstones. The grass was brown with the season's first frost, crunching beneath Cassian's boots as he climbed the slope. Six people attended Rowan's burial. Seven, if you counted Cassian.

The grave had been dug that morning—a neat rectangle of dark earth that smelled of clay and roots. The gravediggers stood at a respectful distance, leaning on their spades, waiting. The simple pine coffin rested on ropes beside the hole.

Brother Marcus spoke the traditional words—dust and ashes, the eternal cycle, rest in the light. His voice carried across the hilltop, competing with the wind. The priest had never met Rowan, and it showed. The eulogy was a template, generic enough to apply to anyone who'd died without particular distinction or shame. "A man of conviction... devoted to his pursuits... now at peace in the eternal light..."

The words washed over Cassian like water over stone. He focused instead on keeping his breathing steady, on not looking at the coffin too directly, on the feeling of his father's letter folded in his coat pocket. He'd found it three days ago while sorting through the cottage. *To be opened after my burial,* it had said in his father's increasingly shaky handwriting.

Cassian hadn't opened it yet. He wasn't ready to hear his father's last words—not when he'd spent so many years refusing to listen to the man.

When Marcus finished, he looked at Cassian expectantly. The small gathering shifted uncomfortably. Someone coughed.

Cassian hadn't prepared anything. He'd been at the counting house until the last possible moment, and before that he'd spent three days sorting through his father's affairs, which consisted mostly of debts, faded maps, and books about legends no one believed. What was there to say? That Rowan had been a disappointment? That Cassian had spent his childhood explaining away his father's eccentricities to the neighbors? That the man in the coffin had traded a good life for delusions?

But standing here, with the wind pulling at his coat and the smell of turned earth in his nostrils, Cassian found he couldn't simply let the priest's hollow words be the final comments on his father's life.

He stepped forward, his boots loud on the frost-hardened ground. He looked down at the simple pine coffin. Rowan had requested no marker, no monument. *"Spend the money on something useful,"* he'd said in one of his last coherent moments, voice thin and papery. *"I won't be there to see it anyway."*

"My father," Cassian began, and his voice came out rougher than he'd intended. He cleared his throat, aware of every eye on him. "My father was not an easy man to understand."

A few awkward shifts among the mourners. That was putting it kindly. The baker—Master Grenn—looked at his feet. The town clerk studied the clouds.

"He spent his fortune—our fortune—chasing stories. Lost cities. Monsters that supposedly existed before history began." Cassian looked up at the small crowd. He recognized them all: Grenn, who'd known Rowan in better days, when there was still money for fresh bread every morning. Clerk Hennis from the town hall, who probably felt obligated to attend after what had happened that afternoon. The landlady from two streets over. A few others whose names he'd forgotten, drawn perhaps by curiosity or the morbid appeal of a madman's funeral. "Most people thought he was mad. Maybe he was."

He should stop there. Let the priest finish the burial, go home, move on with his life. Accept that his father had been a fool and die someday as the son who'd been too sensible to repeat his mistakes.

But the smell of the earth—rich and dark and final—triggered something.

A memory, sharp and unexpected:

*He was eight years old, sitting at the kitchen table after midnight, forbidden to be awake but unable to sleep. His father sat across from him, a candle burning between them, a tarnished coin spread out on a cloth. Rowan's eyes had been bright, feverish with excitement.*

*"Do you see it, Cassian? Look closely. The symbols aren't random—they're a language. A way of understanding the world."*

*Young Cassian had looked, but saw only scratches in old metal. "It's just a coin, Father."*

*"No." Rowan had gripped his shoulder, urgent. "It's not 'just' anything. Everything you see is more than it appears. The world wants you to see surfaces, Cassian. But truth lives deeper."*

*His mother had appeared in the doorway, exhausted and frustrated. "Rowan, it's after midnight. Let the boy sleep."*

*But his father had looked at him with such desperate hope. "You'll understand someday. I know you will."*

*Cassian had gone to bed angry, wishing he had a normal father who worked normal hours and cared about normal things.*

The memory left a bitter taste in his mouth. He'd never understood. Not then, not at twelve when his mother died and Rowan sold her jewelry to fund another expedition, not at sixteen when he'd had to apologize to creditors at the door. Not until this moment, standing over a pine box containing a man who'd spent his life talking of things no one else cared about.

But he thought of all the small moments when his father had chosen to do the right thing simply because it was right, even when it cost him everything. Rowan had paid the baker even when it meant going hungry himself. He'd testified truthfully in court when lying would have been profitable. He'd chased truth like other men chased gold, and been scorned for it.

"But he believed that truth mattered," Cassian continued, his voice stronger now. "That there are things worth pursuing even if the world calls you a fool for it. He believed in things beyond what we can measure in money or status or the approval of our peers." He paused, throat tightening. "I didn't understand that when he was alive. I resented him for it. But I think... Maybe he was trying to show me things I wasn't ready to see."

The words hung in the cold air. No one spoke.

"I'm sorry, Father," Cassian said, quieter now, speaking to the coffin more than the gathered mourners. "For not listening. For not believing. For wishing you were someone else."

He stepped back, blinking against the sting in his eyes that he told himself was just the wind.

Brother Marcus concluded the ceremony with a final blessing. The gravediggers moved forward, and the coffin was lowered into the earth with a creaking of ropes. It settled at the bottom with a muffled thump that seemed too final, too absolute.

The mourners dispersed quickly—there would be no gathering afterward, no shared meal. Rowan had no close friends left, and Cassian had no money to host one. Master Grenn touched his shoulder briefly as he passed, saying nothing. Clerk Hennis met his eyes and nodded, something like respect in his expression.

Then Cassian was alone on the hilltop, just him and the gravediggers who waited at a polite distance for him to leave so they could finish their work.

He couldn't move. Couldn't stop watching as the first shovelful of earth fell onto the pine lid with a hollow sound. Then another. Then another. Each one burying his father a little deeper, making the separation a little more permanent.

The wind tugged at his coat, at the dead leaves skittering across the frozen grass. Down in the valley, Millhaven spread out in its comfortable ignorance—people cooking dinner, children playing, merchants counting their day's earnings. Life continuing as if nothing had changed.

But everything had changed. Cassian felt it in his chest, a hollowness where certainty used to be. He'd spent his whole life trying to be the opposite of his father—practical, grounded, respectable. And where had it gotten him? Standing alone on a hill, watching a man disappear into the ground with nothing to show for his life but debts and delusions.

Or maybe not delusions. Maybe truths that Cassian had been too blind to recognize.

He reached into his coat pocket and felt the folded letter. His father's last words, still unread. He pulled it out, the paper rough against his cold fingers.

Not here. Not yet.

He tucked it back into his pocket and made himself turn away from the grave, from the sound of earth falling on wood, from the gravediggers' quiet conversation. His legs felt heavy as he started back down the hill toward town.

Toward the empty cottage that was now his only inheritance.

Toward what his father had left behind.

---

Rowan's dwelling was a small cottage on the edge of Millhaven, close enough to be respectable but far enough that the neighbors didn't complain about the clutter. Cassian had spent most of the last three days here, sorting and cataloging, trying to make sense of decades of accumulated obsession.

The main room was lined with shelves, every surface covered in books, scrolls, fragments of pottery, rusted tools, and sketches of symbols that meant nothing to anyone but Rowan. His father had organized them according to some system only he understood—groupings by era, maybe, or origin, or the myths they related to.

Cassian had been methodical in his sorting. Books in one pile for potential sale to collectors. Obvious junk in another for disposal. Personal items—clothing, a few letters from Cassian's mother before she died, a locked journal Cassian hadn't been able to open—in a third.

The travel chest stood against the far wall, beneath a window that overlooked a scraggly garden Rowan had never tended. Cassian had already gone through it once: travel-worn clothes, a compass with a cracked face, maps of regions so remote Cassian couldn't identify them. Nothing of value.

He grabbed it by the handles, intending to drag it to the discard pile with the rest of the worthless accumulation.

The chest didn't budge.

Cassian frowned and tried again, putting his back into it. The thing was heavier than he remembered. Far heavier. Had he even lifted it properly the first time he'd moved it? His arms ached from three days of sorting and carrying, from the funeral, from the weight of everything. Maybe he was just exhausted.

But the discrepancy nagged at him. He was a ledger-keeper—his life was noticing things that didn't add up.

He knelt and examined the chest more carefully. Old oak, iron fittings, worn leather straps. He'd already cataloged the contents. Unless...

Cassian knocked on the bottom. The sound was dull, muffled. He knocked again on the side. The difference was subtle but distinct—the kind of difference that came from empty space where there shouldn't be any.

His heart rate picked up. He ran his hands along the interior, pressing against the wooden panels. The sides were solid. The corners yielded nothing. But when he pushed against the bottom near the back left corner—

Click.

The sound was so quiet he almost missed it. A section of the bottom shifted beneath his fingers, sliding sideways with the smoothness of a mechanism that had been used many times. A false compartment, perfectly concealed, its seam invisible unless you knew exactly where to press.

Inside, nestled in the hidden space, lay a stone box.

Cassian's breath caught. He lifted it out with trembling hands. It was small, perhaps twice the size of his fist, carved from dark gray stone that had been polished to a glass-like smoothness. The craftsmanship was extraordinary—no chisel marks, no imperfections, as if it had been made for a king's palace.

On the lid, words were carved in crisp, precise letters that seemed to catch and hold the lamplight:

*COUNT THE COST*

This wasn't like the other artifacts scattered around the room—cheap curiosities bought from market charlatans or dug from suspicious "ancient ruins" that turned out to be fifty-year-old trash heaps. This was *real*. This was something his father had *hidden*, kept secret even from his obsessive catalogs and meticulous journals.

Cassian set the stone box on the table and stared at it. The weight in his hands had been wrong—too heavy for its size, as if the stone were denser than it should be, as if the object inside possessed its own gravity.

*Should I open it?*

His father had hidden it. Had wanted it concealed. Maybe there was a reason. Maybe some things were meant to stay buried with the dead.

But the inscription stared back at him. *COUNT THE COST.* Not a warning, exactly. More like... instruction. Or invitation.

Cassian took a breath and opened the box.

The lid moved easily, revealing a bed of worn crimson velvet. And there, cradled in the fabric's folds, lay what looked like a coin.

But it wasn't a coin. Not quite.

It was larger than any currency Cassian had seen, a small medallion—perhaps two inches across. When he picked it up, the weight shocked him. It was impossibly heavy, as if it were made of something denser than gold, heavier than lead, compressed with a weight that belonged to something far larger.

One side was smooth and black as polished obsidian. The surface didn't just reflect the lamplight—it *absorbed* it, creating a perfect void in his palm that seemed to pull at his vision. Carved into the black surface were symbols, strange alien markings that twisted and curved in ways that made his eyes hurt to follow. They writhed at the edge of perception, never quite staying still. They were nothing like any script he'd studied—not the old imperial characters, not the trader's glyphs, not even the archaic temple writings his father had tried to teach him.

Yet somehow, looking at them, he *understood*.

Not words, exactly. More like concepts that bypassed language entirely and seared themselves directly into his mind:

*Worth. Exchange. Balance. Cost.*

Cassian turned the medallion over with fingers that had gone numb. The other side was completely different—almost rough, dull gold that reflected the lamplight dimly, as if tarnished by ages beyond counting. No markings on this side, only the raw texture of metal. The edge was irregular, almost jagged in places, as if this piece had once been ripped from another object.

The medallion was warm in his palm. Not the ambient warmth of an object left in sunlight, but an active, feverish heat that seemed to pulse with a rhythm like a heartbeat. Like something alive.

Cassian's own heart hammered in his chest. *What is this?*

Before he could think better of it, before caution could override curiosity, he closed his fist around the medallion.

The world *shifted*.

Heat surged up his arm—not painful, but overwhelming, impossible to ignore. It spread through his chest, into his head, behind his eyes. For a moment he couldn't breathe, couldn't see, couldn't think beyond the sensation of something vast pressing against the inside of his skull, trying to fit itself into a space far too small to contain it.

Then, like a door opening in a room he hadn't known existed, *understanding* flooded through him.

His vision blurred, doubled, then snapped into sudden, terrible clarity.

The world looked the same. The cluttered room, the lamplight casting long shadows, the open travel chest on the floor, the scattered artifacts of his father's obsession.

But there was something else now. Something layered over reality like a second skin.

*Shimmer*.

That was the only word for it. A faint, barely-perceptible gleam that hung in the air around objects, like heat haze on a summer road, like the distortion of light through water. It clung to everything—the lamp, the books, the wooden table, the stone box—painting each object with an aura of meaning that had always been there but invisible until this moment.

Cassian stared at the lamp. The shimmer around it was steady and warm, not bright but persistent. And somehow, inexplicably, he could *read* it. Not with his eyes but with some new sense the medallion had awakened. He understood its value—not the price someone might pay for it in the market, but its *worth*. The comfort of light in darkness. The oil that kept it burning, bought with coins earned through labor. The wick someone had trimmed that morning, a small act of maintenance that kept chaos at bay.

He turned to look at the books. The shimmer there was different—layered, complex, tinged with colors he had no names for. Knowledge preserved. Hours spent copying words by hand. Wisdom passed from mind to mind across centuries. Each book glowed with the accumulated value of every person who had touched it, read it, learned from it.

The travel chest itself shimmered with memory and use. Journeys taken. Miles traveled. The hands that had carved and assembled it, the merchant who had sold it, the years of service it had given.

Cassian's hands were shaking violently now. The medallion burned against his palm like a coal. He tried to set it down, but his fingers wouldn't obey. Or perhaps he didn't truly want to let go.

*What have you left me, Father?*

His eyes fell on the open stone box, and he saw there was something else inside. A folded piece of paper tucked beneath the velvet lining where the medallion had rested.

With his free hand, he pulled it out. His father's handwriting covered the page, the letters increasingly shaky toward the end—written, perhaps, in those final days when Rowan's hands had trembled and his mind had flickered in and out of clarity.

Cassian read.

*Cassian—*

*If you're reading this, then I've finally let go of the thread I've been holding all these years. I'm sorry I couldn't explain this to your face. You would have thought me mad. Perhaps you still do.*

*What you hold is older than kingdoms, older than the myths that remember it. I spent my life trying to understand it, and in the end, I can only tell you what little I learned:*

*It chooses its bearer. Not by merit, not by birthright, but by something I never fully grasped.*

*It will show you what things are worth. Not by the price of men, but their true value. The two are rarely the same.*

*Everything has a cost. Always.*

*I don't know if it will accept you as it accepted me. But if it does, I pray you are wiser than I was. I tried to use it to chase shadows and in the process I lost everything of real value. Don't make the same mistake I made.*

*The Hollow is coming, Cassian. I heard the stories before I died—refugees fleeing something that empties people from the inside. I fear I now understand what that means, though I hope I'm wrong.*

*If I'm right, this may be the only thing that can stop them. Or at least understand them.*

*Be careful, son. And forgive your short-sighted father.*

*— R.*

Cassian read the note twice, then a third time. The Hollow. The refugees who'd been trickling into Millhaven over the past few weeks, speaking of towns where people traded away their suffering and became empty husks.

Most of the locals dismissed it as superstition. Mass hysteria. But the refugees kept coming, and their fear was real.

*It will show you what things are truly worth.*

Cassian stared at the letter, then at the medallion still burning in his palm. His father had carried this power for decades. Had seen the world through this lens of impossible meaning. No wonder people had thought him mad—how could you explain this to someone who couldn't see it?

He needed to understand it. To test it.

Slowly, deliberately, Cassian looked at the objects scattered around his father's cottage. The shimmer responded immediately, overwhelming in its intensity. Too much information flooding his senses at once—layers upon layers of value and meaning threatening to drown him.

He squeezed his eyes shut, took a breath, and tried again. This time, he focused on a single object: his father's old journal, the one he hadn't been able to open because the lock was rusted shut.

The shimmer around it was complex, shot through with colors he had no names for. But as he concentrated, the chaos resolved into something more coherent. He could sense the value of the journal itself—not monetary, but *significant*. Years of his father's thoughts, locked away. Secrets. Understanding. Maybe even instructions for how to use this very power.

Worth opening. Worth preserving.

But there was something else, too. A cost attached to it. If he forced the lock, he'd damage the journal, destroy some of what was written inside. The value would decrease. The optimal solution would be to find a key, or pick the lock carefully, or—

His head throbbed. The information was too abstract, too layered. He was trying to read a language he'd only just discovered.

Cassian set the journal down and tried something simpler. The lamp. The shimmer there was steady, easier to parse. Light. Warmth. Security against the dark. The oil inside had been purchased with coin, which had been earned through labor. Simple chains of value, easier to follow.

Better. He was learning.

He looked at the bread crumbs on the table from yesterday's meal—the last food he'd bought before his father died. The shimmer was faint, almost gone. Used up. Consumed. Value transformed from potential sustenance into past nourishment. The worth was spent.

*So the power doesn't just show value—it shows the state of value. Active, potential, depleted.*

Cassian's pulse quickened. He wasn't just seeing prices. He was understanding the fundamental value of things, how it flowed through the world, how it changed and transformed and accumulated.

His father had tried to use this to find ancient treasures, lost cities, legendary artifacts. But the real treasure was the ability itself. The power to see what mattered. To understand—

A knock at the door shattered his concentration.

The shimmer vanished, or rather, he lost his focus on it. It was still there, he realized—he just couldn't see it clearly when his attention was divided. Like trying to read in dim light.

Cassian fumbled the medallion back into the stone box, closed it, and shoved it into his coat pocket. His heart was hammering, his head still spinning from the effort of interpreting the visions. "Just a moment!"

He steadied himself against the door frame for a breath, then opened it.

Widow Marta stood on the threshold, a small cloth bundle in her hands.

"I'm sorry to intrude, Master Cassian," she said quietly. She looked exhausted, her face lined with the kind of weariness that came from too many years of grief and worry. Dark circles shadowed her eyes, and her shawl was threadbare at the edges. "I heard about the funeral. And about what you did today. With the ledger."

"It was nothing, Mistress Marta. Just my duty."

"It wasn't nothing to us." She held out the bundle, and he caught the smell of fresh bread, still faintly warm. "It's not much. Just some bread. But I wanted... I wanted you to know that what you did mattered. Your father would have been proud."

Cassian started to protest, to say she shouldn't have, that she needed it more than he did. But the words died in his throat.

Because he *saw* it.

The shimmer blazed to life around the bread, brilliant and pure—not the golden glow of wealth or treasure, but something deeper, more fundamental. The vision flooded his mind with understanding:

*Hours worked at the laundry, back aching, hands raw from lye. Coins saved, copper by copper, choosing between flour and lamp oil. Choosing flour. Kneading dough by candlelight while children slept. Baking it in a borrowed oven. Carrying it here instead of feeding her family.*

*And beneath it all: gratitude. Genuine, given freely.*

This wasn't just bread. It was sacrifice. Dignity and respect offered by someone who had every reason to hoard what little they possessed.

The value of it was staggering—not measured in silver or gold, but in something more precious. A gift given when nothing was owed, from someone who could barely afford to give.

It was worth more than gold. More than anything he'd seen today.

Cassian's vision blurred. He blinked rapidly, his throat tight. "Thank you," he whispered, and his voice cracked on the words. He took the bundle with trembling hands, and the weight of it—both physical and something immeasurably greater—settled into his palms like a trust he didn't deserve. "Thank you, Marta. This... this means more than you know."

She smiled, a tired but genuine expression that eased some of the deep lines in her face. "You gave us hope today, Master Cassian. The least we can do is give you supper."

She turned to leave, and Cassian stood frozen in the doorway, watching her walk back toward Southgate district. The shimmer followed her—a faint, steady glow that spoke of resilience, of stubborn hope in the face of endless struggle. Of a woman who refused to break under circumstances that should have crushed her years ago.

*That,* he thought. *That's what my father was trying to show me.*

He looked down at the bread again, at the faint golden shimmer that still clung to it. Then at his hands, which trembled with exhaustion and overwhelm. Then at the world around him, where every object, every person, every fleeting moment carried its own impossible weight of meaning.

*What things are worth.*

Cassian closed the door and leaned against it, sliding down to sit on the floor, still holding the bread. The medallion in his pocket burned against his chest through the cloth of the stone box.

He didn't fully understand what was happening to him. He didn't know what his father had truly given him, or what he was supposed to do with this terrible, beautiful power. But he knew one thing with absolute certainty:

Nothing would ever look the same again.

---

That night, Cassian sat at the small table in his father's cottage, the stone box open before him. The medallion gleamed in the lamplight—black void on one side, dull gold on the other.

He'd tried to set it aside. Tried to convince himself he'd imagined the shimmer, the weight, the impossible senses that had flooded through him when he touched it.

But the world hadn't returned to normal. Every object still carried its ghost of meaning. Every shadow held layers of value he'd never perceived before.

He picked up the medallion again, and the warmth flooded back immediately, stronger now. The symbols on the smooth black side seemed to writhe in the flickering light, never quite holding still, always dancing at the edge of comprehension.

*Worth. Exchange. Balance. Cost.*

His stomach growled, and he remembered Marta's bread still sitting by the door. He retrieved it, unwrapping the cloth, and broke off a piece.

The moment it touched his tongue, the shimmer exploded through his senses.

*Wheat grown in fields west of town. Harvested by hands that ached from the work. Ground by a miller who charged fair prices because his father had taught him to. Baked by a woman who chose kindness.*

Every bite was a chain of human effort and choice, stretching back through time. He could taste the value of it—not just the nourishment entering his body, but the significance of every action that had brought this bread into existence. The farmer's labor. The miller's integrity. Marta's sacrifice.

It was too much. Too overwhelming. He set the bread down with shaking hands, his eyes stinging.

How had his father lived with this? Seeing the weight and worth of everything, every moment, every interaction? No wonder the town thought him mad. How could you explain that a piece of bread isn't just food, but a miracle of human effort and sacrifice?

And if this was what the power showed him about bread—about something simple and ordinary—what would it reveal about other things? About people? Choices?

Fear crept up his spine. He was a ledger-keeper. He dealt in numbers, in certainty, in columns that balanced. This power dealt in abstractions and meanings that shifted and changed. What if he made a mistake? What if he misread the shimmer, misunderstood what something was truly worth?

*There is always a cost,* his father had written.

What would this power cost him?

Outside, the wind rattled the shutters. Somewhere in the distance, he heard voices—refugees, perhaps, arriving in the night. More people fleeing the Hollow, carrying their fear and their stories of towns where people became empty shells.

*The Hollow is coming, Cassian.*

His father had spent his life chasing legends, and everyone called him mad. But what if he had been right? About everything? What if the myths were real, the ancient powers really existed, and this medallion—this impossible, fever-warm artifact—was proof?

What if the Hollow was real too?

Cassian looked at the medallion in his palm, at the void-black side that seemed to pull at the lamplight. If his father was right—if this was the only thing that could understand or stop the Hollow—then ignoring it wasn't an option. Pretending he hadn't found it, burying it back in the chest, returning to his normal life of ledgers and numbers...

He couldn't. Not after seeing what Marta's sacrifice looked like. Not after understanding, for the first time, what his father had been searching for all those years.

*Truth,* Rowan had called it. *Value beyond what we can measure.*

Cassian closed his fist around the medallion, feeling its heat pulse against his palm like a heartbeat. Like something alive and waiting.

"All right, Father," he whispered to the empty room. His voice was steadier now, though fear still coiled in his chest. "I'll try to understand. I'll try to do what you couldn't."

He didn't know if Rowan could hear him. Didn't know if it mattered.

But the medallion's warmth surged when he said this, flowing up his arm and into his chest—not painful, but undeniable. Like an answer to a question he hadn't known how to ask.

Like an oath made to the dead and to himself.

Cassian sat alone in the lamplight, holding an inheritance he barely understood, watching the shadows dance on the walls as his old life ended and something new—something impossible and terrifying and necessary—began.

Tomorrow, he would return to the counting house. He would face Torven's consequences. He would continue doing his job, maintaining accuracy, ensuring the numbers were accurate and fair.

But tonight, the world had changed. And he had changed with it.

The medallion pulsed against his palm, and Cassian didn't try to set it down again.
