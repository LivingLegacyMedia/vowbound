# Chapter 20: A Lost Fight

Three thousand heartbeats pulsed through Cassian's veins—none of them his own.

The Coin of Seeds channeled their strength like a river finding the sea. Not just the eighty who'd committed from the start, but hundreds more accepting the trade in real-time as they watched him nearly die. Their vitality flooded through him, knitting torn flesh, surging through muscles with supernatural force.

Draven recovered from being thrown, his expression shifting from shock to something harder to read. Not quite rage. Calculation. "Clever trick. But it won't be enough."

He drew deeper on his network—ten thousand Hollow across the kingdom, all siphoning vitality to him involuntarily. The Coin of Oxen blazed at his throat, granting him strength that transcended human limits.

They clashed again.

This time, Cassian matched him. Fist met fist with impacts that cracked the ground. They moved across the plains in a blur, each strike carrying enough force to shatter stone. The watching crowd scattered back, giving them space.

But Cassian could feel the strain. He was channeling thousands of connections—managing the flow of energy from willing volunteers, distributing it through his body, preventing any one person from being drained too far. It required intense concentration. One mistake and he could accidentally kill someone by taking too much.

Draven had no such concerns. He simply *took* from his network without restraint, pushing the cost onto enslaved victims who had no choice but to bear it.

"You're holding back," Draven taunted, driving a kick that Cassian barely blocked. "Afraid you'll hurt your precious volunteers. I have no such weakness. I can drain my network to nothing if needed. Can you say the same?"

He was right. Cassian felt someone in the crowd flagging—a young woman who'd offered too much too fast. He had to reduce her connection, slow the flow, which meant slightly less power available.

Draven sensed it immediately and pressed the advantage. A brutal combination of strikes that drove Cassian back, each one harder than the last.

Across the city, Torin's team reached Veylin's warehouse.

The building was heavily guarded—twenty Hollow standing watch. But Drenneth's soldiers moved with professional efficiency, subduing them quickly.

Torin entered through the eastern door, Perin close behind. They descended to the lowest level where Veylin waited.

She looked up as they entered—a woman in her fifties, eyes empty but aware. "You. The broken one. Come to sever me?"

"Yes."

"It won't work. Even if you disconnect my network, Kane will simply rebuild it. The Hollow need structure. Need someone to organize them. Without me, they'll just beg to reconnect elsewhere."

"Maybe," Torin said. "But I'm taking you anyway."

He reached out with the technique Cassian had taught him—finding the tether that connected Veylin to Draven's central reservoir. The connection pulsed with stolen vitality, drawing from several hundred Hollow through her.

Torin cut it.

Veylin screamed as the tether severed. The sound was inhuman—not quite pain, but the shock of sudden emptiness. Across the eastern district, 800 Hollow gasped as their connections broke simultaneously. Some collapsed. Others stood frozen, feeling the absence like a missing limb.

---

Draven stumbled mid-strike, his eyes going wide. Cassian felt it too through the Coin of Heads—a massive disruption rippling through the network. Hundreds of tethers disconnecting at once.

"What—" Draven turned toward the east, sensing the damage.

Cassian didn't give him time to process. He surged forward, channeling the crowd's energy into a devastating strike that caught Draven in the ribs. Bone cracked. Draven flew back, crashing through the mill wall.

But even wounded, he was dangerous. Draven rose, blood on his lips, fury in his eyes. "You're attacking the Emissaries. While I'm distracted here."

"Yes."

Another wave rippled through the network—stronger this time. A second Emissary severed. Then a third. Torin and Perin were systematically disconnecting the major nodes, and each severance weakened Draven's foundation.

His power fluctuated as sections of his network went dark. Not destroyed—the Hollow were still hollow, still existed. But temporarily disconnected, unable to channel vitality until tethers were re-established.

The balance of power shifted.

Cassian pressed the attack, matching Draven blow for blow now. The crowd's energy sustained him—not just healing, but enhancing every movement, making him faster, stronger than he'd ever been.

But Draven was adapting. Even bleeding, even with his network fragmenting, he reached for something at his belt—the second locket.

"You want to know why I keep the Coin of Oxen caged?" Draven's voice was cold despite the blood on his teeth. "To hide its cost—let my network bear that burden. But the Coin of Waters?" He opened the second locket. "I usually leave it alone. Because using both coins at once is dangerous."

He opened the locket.

The Coin of Waters blazed free—no longer caged, its power flooding through Draven alongside the Coin of Oxen. The two divine powers surged together, and for a moment Cassian thought they would tear Draven apart.

But they synchronized.

*He's mastered the balance,* Cassian realized. *He's using both simultaneously.*

Draven's wounds began healing—the Coin of Waters manipulating the fluids in his body, knitting tissue back together, clearing blood from his lungs. And his strength redoubled as both coins channeled power through him simultaneously.

"You bonded with two coins," Draven said, his voice carrying across the plains. "So did I. But you use them one at a time. I've spent years learning to wield both together—to balance their demands, to make them cooperate instead of conflicting."

He attacked with renewed fury, water and strength combined. The very moisture in the air became a weapon—Cassian felt his lungs constrict, blood vessels strain under impossible pressure, sweat trying to boil from his skin.

Cassian countered with the Coin of Heads, entering the gray space. He could see the attacks coming before they landed, could sense the flow of Draven's power and adapt in real-time.

But it wasn't enough. Draven had years of experience wielding both his coinsand he had thousands of enslaved Hollow still channeling strength to him.

Cassian was drawing on thousands too now—maybe three thousand connections as more of the crowd accepted the trade. But they were giving freely, which meant he had to be careful. Had to manage each connection, ensure no one died from giving too much.

A strike slipped through Cassian's defenses. Then another. He felt ribs crack, felt blood fill his mouth. The crowd's energy healed him, but slowly, damage mounting faster than restoration.

He was losing.

---

Fourth Emissary severed. Fifth. Sixth.

Torin moved through the city like a ghost, Perin at his side, Drenneth's soldiers providing cover. They hit every major node Torin had identified from lengthy research.

At the sixth location, resistance finally materialized. A guard recognized Torin as he entered. "You! The broken one—you're the ledger-keeper's pet."

The guard lunged. Torin tried to dodge but his body betrayed him—the old stiffness, the damage that never fully healed. The blade would have opened his throat if Perin hadn't intercepted, her own blade flashing.

"Stay focused," she said, breathing hard as the guard fell. "We have one more."

A few hundred Hollow per severance. Sometimes a thousand. The network fragmenting piece by piece, and with each cut, Torin felt the weight of it. These weren't just numbers. They were people—lost, empty, suddenly adrift without the structure that had defined them.

But he pushed forward. Cassian needed this. Needed every advantage they could give him.

---

Draven drove Cassian into the ground with bone-crushing force. The impact created a crater in the plains. Cassian tried to rise, but Draven's boot pressed down on his chest, grinding him into the earth.

"You fought well," Draven said, breathing hard. His wounds were still healing, but he'd taken real damage. More than he'd expected. "Better than your father. Better than the King's father. You actually made me work for this."

Through the Coin of Heads, Cassian could sense the network status. Seven Emissaries severed. Perhaps 6,000 Hollow temporarily disconnected from Draven's power source. It was weakening him—but not enough.

He still had thousands more. Still had dual coins. Still had years of experience.

"But you're still going to lose," Draven continued. "Because at the end of the day, power comes from taking, not asking. Those people giving you energy? They're already tiring. Already withdrawing consent because the cost is too high. My network never tires. Never refuses. Never stops channeling strength."

He was right. Cassian could feel it—hundreds of connections dropping as volunteers hit their limits. The crowd had been willing to help, but sustaining the energy transfer was exhausting. They couldn't maintain it indefinitely.

And Draven could. He could drain his network to death if needed, because the Hollow couldn't refuse.

Cassian reached desperately through the Coin of Heads, trying to find any advantage. Any weakness in Draven's defenses.

And he found something.

The two coins were active simultaneously, both drawing power, both demanding Draven's attention. It was like watching a man juggle flaming torches while running—technically possible, but requiring absolute concentration. One slip and everything would collapse.

Draven had mastered the technique, yes. But the cost was enormous mental strain. Every second he wielded both coins together, he was one mistake away from them tearing him apart from the inside.

If Cassian could disrupt that balance...

He reached out through the Coin of Heads, touching Draven's mind. *The coins are tearing you apart,* he sent. *Even controlled, they're destroying you from the inside. You can feel it, can't you? The constant strain. The pieces of yourself you've sacrificed to keep them balanced.*

Draven's concentration wavered—just for a second.

The coins slipped out of sync.

Draven screamed as pain lanced through him. His boot lifted from Cassian's chest as he staggered back, clutching his head.

Cassian rolled away, gasping. Used the crowd's diminishing energy to heal his worst injuries. Rose on shaky legs.

"Clever," Draven snarled, forcing the coins back into balance through sheer will. "But tricks won't save you. You're running out of power. Out of time. Out of options."

He was right. Cassian could feel maybe a thousand connections still active—the most dedicated volunteers, holding on despite exhaustion. But they couldn't sustain this much longer.

One final gamble.

Cassian reached through the Coin of Seeds to all thousand remaining connections. *I need everything you can give. All of it. Right now. For one final strike.*

He felt their fear bleeding through the bond. Giving everything meant collapsing afterward. Meant being completely drained, potentially dying if they gave too much.

But he also felt their determination. They'd chosen to support him. Chosen to prove that freely given mattered.

One by one, they opened themselves fully. Gave everything they had.

A thousand people, pouring their life force into Cassian simultaneously.

The power was immense. Overwhelming. More than his body could safely contain. But he channeled it anyway, focusing everything into a single strike enhanced by both coins—perception guiding it, growth empowering it.

He moved faster than thought, faster than Draven could track. His fist caught Draven in the sternum with force that shattered the sound barrier.

The impact sent Draven flying across the plains. He crashed through the mill wall, through the interior, out the other side. Finally stopped two hundred paces away, embedded in the earth.

Cassian collapsed, the energy completely spent. The thousand connections went dark as volunteers crumpled, drained to unconsciousness.

Silence.

The crowd watched, holding their breath.

Draven stirred.

He rose slowly, his chest caved in, blood pouring from dozens of wounds. The Coin of Waters worked frantically to heal him, but the damage was catastrophic. Too much for even divine power to fix quickly.

But he was still standing. Still alive. Still functional.

"Impressive," Draven said, his voice wet with blood. He took a step forward. Stumbled. Caught himself. "That actually hurt."

He took another step, then stopped. His eyes swept across the crowd—no longer passive observers but people who'd just seen him bleed. Who'd seen proof that he could be hurt.

And beyond them, Cassian could see through the Coin of Heads what Draven was calculating: Seven Emissaries severed. Six thousand Hollow disconnected and panicking. His dual-coin balance wavering from the impact. The crowd's mood shifting from fear to something more dangerous.

Draven's hand went to his chest, feeling the extent of the damage. His breathing was labored, blood bubbling at his lips. The Coin of Waters was healing him, but slowly. Too slowly.

"You know what's interesting?" Draven said, his voice carrying across the silent plains. "I came here expecting to crush a rebellion. To make an example. Instead..." He looked at Cassian, still collapsed in the crater. "Instead I find myself bleeding, my network fragmenting, and an entire city watching me struggle."

He turned, scanning the crowd more carefully. Cassian could see what he was seeing: people who'd given everything to hurt him. People who were no longer afraid. People who'd tasted resistance and found it possible.

"I could kill you," Draven said, looking back at Cassian. "Right now. Take your coins. Win completely."

He took another step forward, then stopped again. His hand pressed against his ruined chest.

"But here's what happens if I do: I expend what's left of my strength finishing you. The crowd riots—they've already proven they'll sacrifice themselves for you. My network is fragmenting faster than I can rebuild it. And I'm in no condition to fight my way out of a city in open revolt."

Draven's smile was bloody but genuine. "So here's what I'm going to do instead. I'm going to walk away. Rebuild my network. Heal these wounds. And when we meet again—and we will—I'll be ready for your tricks."

"That's not..." Cassian tried to speak, couldn't. Could barely move.

"That's strategy," Draven said. "I've been playing this game for two decades. You think this is the first time I've had to retreat and regroup? The difference between us is that I know when to cut my losses."

He turned to address the crowd. "You've proven resistance is possible. Congratulations. But ask yourselves: at what cost? Look at the people collapsed around you. Look at your ledger-keeper, broken in the dirt. Is this victory? Or just mutual destruction?"

The crowd murmured. They'd won—but the price was visible everywhere. A thousand unconscious volunteers. Cassian unable to stand. The disconnected Hollow wailing in the streets.

"My network will rebuild," Draven continued. "The Hollow will reconnect—because they have no choice, no purpose without structure. And next time, I won't underestimate what you can do with support." His eyes found Cassian. "I'll simply overwhelm you."

He began walking away, limping but steady. The crowd parted for him—some from fear, some from exhaustion, some because they simply didn't know what else to do.

King Aldric stepped forward from the crowd, flanked by Captain Drenneth. "Kane. A word."

Draven paused.

"We're declaring this a truce," the King said. "You withdraw to your territories. We hold ours. Both sides recover. We negotiate terms later."

"A truce implies I need your permission to leave," Draven said. "I'm leaving because it's the smart play. Not because you're allowing it."

"Call it what you want. But if you return to the capital before we've reached an understanding, my soldiers will be ready."

Draven laughed—a wet, pained sound. "Your soldiers. Right. Because they fought me so well today." He gestured at the plains. "Your ledger-keeper and his volunteers did more damage in one fight than your entire army's done in a year."

He kept walking. As he passed King Aldric, he added quietly, "By the way, your friend Mira remains under my authority. The binding holds until Cassian and I reach a true understanding—and today's fight doesn't qualify. She's leverage. Insurance. A guarantee that he'll face me again."

The King's jaw tightened, but he didn't respond.

Draven continued across the plains, his figure growing smaller. The crowd watched in silence as the Supreme Voice—bleeding, wounded, but unbroken—retreated into the distance.

---

The aftermath was chaos.

Medics rushed to treat the thousand volunteers who'd given everything—most were simply unconscious, drained but alive. A few had given too much and required urgent intervention. Cassian used what remained of his strength and the Coin of Seeds to gently restore them, giving back some of what they'd sacrificed.

The seven severed Emissaries left 6,000 Hollow disconnected and panicking across the city. Some wandered the streets, vacant-eyed and lost. Others collapsed where they stood, overwhelmed by the sudden emptiness. Torin coordinated triage efforts, but there weren't enough restoration experts. Weren't enough resources.

Many would seek reconnection. Many would find new Emissaries. The damage they'd inflicted was temporary—but it had been enough.

Cassian collapsed in the medical tent, barely conscious. Through the mental connection, he felt Mira's presence reaching for him across the distance—still bound to Draven, still trapped, but able to touch his mind through the gray space.

Her voice came through clearly, edged with relief and fury. *You idiot. You absolute idiot. You nearly died.*

*But I didn't,* Cassian sent back weakly.

*Only because a thousand people decided to sacrifice themselves!* He could feel her emotions bleeding through the bond—fear, anger, helplessness. *You gambled everything on people's better nature. What if they hadn't?*

*Then I would have died proving what I believed.* Cassian managed a weak mental smile. *But they did help. That matters.*

*Draven's still alive. Still has his network. Still has both coins. And I'm still bound to him.* The last part came out bitter, heavy with frustration.

*I know.* The reality of that hit him hard. *I'm sorry. I thought if I fought him, if we reached some kind of understanding—*

*You did what you could. He's wounded. His network is damaged. You bought us time.* A pause. *That's more than anyone's done in twenty years.*

*It's not enough. Not while you're still—*

*It's enough for now,* she interrupted. *Focus on healing. On building what you started here. I'll survive. I always do.*

The connection began to fade as exhaustion overwhelmed him. But he felt her presence linger, watching over him even from wherever Draven had taken her.

*Don't die,* she sent. *I mean it. Don't you dare die before you figure out how to break this binding.*

*I won't,* he promised.

*Good. Because I have a lot of very angry things to say to you when I'm free, and you need to be alive to hear them.*

Despite everything—the pain, the exhaustion, the weight of what they'd lost—Cassian felt himself smile.

King Aldric entered the tent as Mira's presence faded. "The truce will hold for now. Draven's retreating to his western territories. My scouts report he's lost perhaps a third of his network between the severances and Hollow fleeing after seeing him wounded. It'll take him months to rebuild."

"And us?" Cassian asked.

"We have thousands of volunteers who just learned they can make a difference. Hundreds of disconnected Hollow who need restoration. And a city that saw their ledger-keeper make the Supreme Voice bleed." The King's expression was complex—pride mixed with concern. "I'd say we have work to do."

"My father tried this. Freeing emissaries, gathering allies. It didn't save him."

"No," the King agreed. "But it inspired you to try again. And maybe you'll inspire whoever comes after." He gestured toward the tent opening, where the sounds of recovery efforts filtered through. "That's how change happens. Not in single victories, but in people choosing to keep trying."

---

Three months later.

Cassian kicked open the door to the compound, eighty-seven volunteers at his back.

The Emissary inside looked up from her desk—one of Draven's agents, recently arrived to rebuild the network in the eastern district. Her eyes widened as she recognized him.

"You can't—"

"I can." Cassian crossed the room in three strides. Through the Coin of Heads, he could see her network—two hundred Hollow tethered to her, their vitality being siphoned involuntarily. "You've been taking without consent. That ends now."

She reached for the alarm bell, but Torin was faster. His blade pinned her hand to the desk.

"Scream if you want," Torin said. "We own this district now."

Cassian reached out through the technique he had learned—finding the central tether that connected the Emissary to Draven's greater network. He could feel the stolen vitality pulsing through it, two hundred lives reduced to fuel.

He severed it.

The Emissary shrieked as the connection broke. Around the district, two hundred Hollow gasped as their bonds shattered. Some collapsed. Others stood frozen, feeling freedom for the first time in years.

But Cassian wasn't done. He turned to the volunteers who'd followed him—former Hollow, restoration experts, people who'd learned what freely given actually meant. "Get them stabilized. Anyone who wants reconnection, they choose their path. No coercion. No lies."

The volunteers scattered, moving to help the newly freed Hollow who were stumbling through the streets.

The Emissary clutched her chest, feeling the sudden emptiness. "Draven will—"

"Draven is rebuilding in the west," Cassian interrupted. "I'm rebuilding here. And every day, I'm going to dismantle one more piece of his network until he has nothing left to stand on."

Through his mental connection to Mira, he felt her presence surge with fierce approval. She was still bound to Draven, still trapped in his western stronghold, but watching through their link.

*That's more like it,* she sent. *Quit studying and start breaking things.*

*I learned from the best,* he replied, feeling her grim satisfaction echo back.

He looked at the Emissary—defeated, disconnected, powerless. Three months ago, he'd fought Draven to a standstill and barely survived. The Supreme Voice had retreated, wounded but alive, to rebuild his strength.

Fine. Let him rebuild.

Because Cassian was rebuilding too. Not just gathering allies or forming networks, but actively hunting Draven's agents. Severing connections. Freeing Hollow. Taking back territory one district at a time.

King Aldric's intelligence network had identified seventeen of Draven's remaining Emissaries. This was the eighth one Cassian had personally disconnected. Nine more to go.

"Tell your master something," Cassian said to the former Emissary. "Tell him I'm not waiting for him to come to me. Tell him I'm coming for every piece of his network, every enslaved Hollow, every forced connection. And when I've dismantled enough of it, I'm coming for him."

He turned and walked out, his volunteers falling in behind him. Outside, the newly freed Hollow were being stabilized, given water, offered choices instead of commands.

Some would accept reconnection—to the cooperative network Cassian was building, where power flowed freely instead of being stolen. Others would refuse, wanting nothing to do with any network ever again.

Both were valid. Both were *choices*.

That was what Draven would never understand. Why he'd ultimately lose.

Cassian felt the evening breeze, the weight of both coins in his pockets, the pulse of eighty-seven willing connections humming through the network. Not thousands. Not yet.

But growing. Every freed district. Every severed Emissary. Every person who chose cooperation over coercion.

His father had tried to build something better and died for it.

Mira was still suffering for believing in it.

And Cassian? He was going to finish what they'd started. Through action. Through tearing down Draven's empire piece by piece until there was nothing left but the choice: change or fall.

Torin caught up to him. "Next target?"

Cassian pulled out the map marked with Draven's remaining strongholds. "The compound in the merchant district. They've been taking children."

"When?"

"Tonight."

Torin grinned—the fierce expression of someone who'd spent too long broken and was finally getting to break something back. "Good."

Somewhere in the west, Draven was rebuilding. Plotting. Preparing for their next confrontation.

Let him prepare.

Cassian was done waiting for permission to fight. Done hoping for peaceful solutions with people who dealt in slavery. Done being careful.

He'd made the Supreme Voice bleed once.

Next time, he'd make him fall.

The volunteers moved through the district like a storm, freeing the enslaved, offering choices to the desperate, building something that couldn't be broken by force alone.

And in the fading light, Cassian smiled.

This was just the beginning.
