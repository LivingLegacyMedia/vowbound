# Chapter 20: Freely Given

Cassian returned to the palace just before dawn, exhausted from the confrontation. His clothes were still damp, and the coins felt heavier than ever in his pocket.

Torin intercepted him in the eastern wing, looking unsettlingly alert for someone who should have been sleeping.

"I found something in the archives," Torin said without preamble.

Cassian blinked, trying to focus through his exhaustion. "And?"

"Your father was working with the previous king. They discovered how Draven's network operates—through Emissaries. Sever an Emissary, and everyone connected through them disconnects simultaneously." Torin's expression didn't change. "Your father attempted it. Failed catastrophically."

The words hit Cassian like cold water. "My father worked with the King?"

"Up until he died." Torin's voice was flat, factual. "I found his final report. He challenged Draven to single combat, lost, and left one message: 'Build what Kane can't.'"

The coins burned in Cassian's pocket. His father. Working with the King. Against Draven. Dying for it.

"Why didn't anyone tell me?"

"I don't know. But his research gives us an opening." Torin handed him a slim folder. "Veylin Marr commands the largest Emissary network—600 to 800 Hollow. If we sever her during your confrontation with Draven, we fragment his power base."

Cassian's hands clenched. "Veylin. The one who took Mira."

"Yes. She's a strategic target." Torin paused. "But there's a problem. When your father severed emissaries, he failed because those disconnected had no framework for recovery. Many died. Others begged to reconnect."

"I can restore them. The Coin of Seeds has the power—"

"Not 800 people." Torin's gaze was steady. "Your father's final message said to build what Draven can't. I think he meant a kind of network."

---

King Aldric arranged an emergency meeting within the hour. Perin arrived with Elena. Three refugees who'd been freed from the Hollow state. Captain Drenneth. The King himself.

They gathered in a small war room, maps of the city spread across the table.

Torin laid out the plan with mechanical precision. "Emissary structure. Veylin commands the largest network. While Cassian confronts Draven, we sever her connection. Temporarily redirect those tethers—hold them ourselves if necessary."

"And then what?" Perin asked. "They'll be disconnected. Lost. Your father tried severance and it failed—"

"Because he tried to make it permanent," Torin said. "This is different. We hold the connections temporarily. Keep them from feeding Draven during the fight. Some might reconnect immediately. Some might choose freedom. Most will be confused, disoriented."

"Chaos," Drenneth said.

"Yes. But chaos buys time." Torin's expression didn't change. "Eight hundred Hollow no longer organized, no longer fighting for Draven—even if they're never restored, even if they reconnect later—it weakens him in the moment that matters."

Cassian saw the logic. "It's not about saving them. It's about disrupting his power base during the fight."

"Exactly. Your father tried to free people permanently without having the means. We're just creating temporary disruption." Torin paused. "Some may choose freedom when given the chance. But that's secondary. The goal is to drain Draven's strength while he's occupied with you."

"That's brutal," one refugee said quietly.

"It's war," the King replied. "And if Cassian can match Draven's strength during those few minutes of disruption—if he can actually win—then we save everyone. Permanently."

Cassian stared at the map, thinking it through. The plan didn't require restoring 800 people. It required temporarily breaking Draven's connection to them while Cassian fought.

But he'd still need power to match Draven. Even with 800 Hollow temporarily disrupted, Draven would still have thousands more feeding him strength.

"I need people to support me," Cassian said slowly. "A voluntary network. The opposite of what Draven built."

"You're talking about asking the town to give you their energy?" Drenneth looked skeptical. "You think they would they agree to that?"

"I'm offering a trade. Their strength for my service. Their energy, given willingly, to fight for their freedom."

"And if they refuse?"

"Then I fight with whatever I have." Cassian's jaw tightened. "But if enough accept... I might have power Draven can't match. He draws from enslaved victims. I'd draw from willing supporters."

"You're talking about challenging him to single combat," Drenneth said. "Physically."

"Why not? He'll expect negotiation, clever tactics. He won't expect a direct challenge." Cassian's jaw tightened. "And while he's distracted fighting me, Torin and Perin sever the Emissaries. Even if it's temporary, even if it creates chaos—it drains his power in the moment that matters."

"That's insane," Drenneth muttered. But he was almost smiling. "Completely insane."

"My father tried wisdom," Cassian said. "The King's father tried strength. Both died alone. Maybe what works is fighting together—with people who choose to stand with you."

The King nodded slowly. "Build what Kane can't." He looked at Cassian. "Make the offer. Give them the choice."

---

They spent the day preparing. Cassian practiced channeling energy through the Coin of Seeds—taking Perin's offered vitality and redirecting it, learning to be a conduit rather than just a source.

It was harder than he expected. Even small amounts of transferred energy left him shaking, his head pounding from the strain.

"You'll burn out," Torin observed, watching him struggle. "The volume will overwhelm you."

"Then I burn out fighting." Cassian wiped sweat from his forehead. "Better than watching Draven win."

Perin rested a hand on his shoulder. "The people will help. You'll see."

But Cassian couldn't shake the doubt. Why would strangers give their energy to someone they barely knew? Why would they trust him against an enemy they feared?

The King made arrangements for a public assembly. A gathering at sunset on the plains outside the city walls. Word spread quickly—the ledger-keeper was challenging the Supreme Voice.

Most expected to watch him die.

---

That evening, Cassian couldn't sleep. He stood in the palace courtyard under stars, both coins burning in his palms.

Tomorrow he'd make an offer to a town that barely knew him. Ask them to give freely of their strength to power a fight most didn't believe he could win.

And if they refused, he'd face Draven alone.

He felt the thread to Mira pulse weakly—still dampened, but present. Cassian closed his eyes and pushed along the connection, harder than before.

The world shifted.

Gray space. The liminal place between minds. This time, he could feel Mira's presence even stronger, her figure even took visible form.

She stood across from him, looking exhausted but alert. Her eyes widened. "Cassian?"

"Still in his camp?" He already knew the answer, could feel it through their connection.

"My oath binds me." Her voice was steady, but he could sense her fear bleeding through the bond. "Cassian, I've felt everything through our connection. You're going to die tomorrow."

"Maybe."

"You against his entire network?" She stepped closer. Here in this mental space, he could feel her more clearly than he had in weeks. "He has thousands of Hollow feeding him power. That's not a fight. That's suicide."

"It's the only move I have." He reached out, and their hands met—not physically, but in the strange half-real way of this place. "Maybe others will agree to help. And if they don't...at least my sacrifice will have meaning."

Through their connection, he felt her anguish. "I don't want meaning. I want you alive."

"I want that too." He pulled her closer. "But I can't run. Not when there's even the smallest chance this works."

"Then I'll be trapped here. Watching through this connection as he kills you. Unable to do anything."

"Or you'll watch me win."

Her expression crumpled. "Don't make promises you can't keep."

"I'm not promising victory. Just that I'll try." He paused, feeling the weight of everything unsaid between them. "If this goes wrong—if I don't come back—I need you to know that all of it mattered. You matter."

Through their connection, he felt her grief—raw and overwhelming. Not just fear for him, but fury at her own helplessness.

"When this is over," she said quietly, "when you somehow survive this insanity—we're going to have a long conversation about your definition of 'trying.'"

Despite everything, he almost smiled. "Deal."

The space began to fade. The connection couldn't hold much longer.

"Don't die," Mira said. Not a plea. A command.

"I'll do my best."

The gray space dissolved. Cassian opened his eyes back in the courtyard, alone, his cheeks wet.

---

Dawn came cold and bright. Elena arrived with Perin, insisting she needed to see Cassian before he left.

She looked up at him with solemn eyes. "Papa says you're going to fight the bad man."

"I'm going to try."

"Will you win?"

Cassian knelt to her level. "I don't know."

She thought about that, then nodded. "Papa says sometimes trying is more important than winning. Because if you don't try, you already lost." She threw her arms around his neck. "Be careful. And come back."

Cassian's throat tightened. "I will."

---

By sunset, the plains outside the city walls were packed. Thousands of people—merchants, laborers, refugees, nobles, beggars, soldiers—lined the walls and filled the open ground, creating a sea of faces stretching to the horizon.

At the center stood the old mill where Draven had agreed to meet him.

Cassian walked across the plains in simple worker's clothes, not finery. If he was asking people to trust him, he needed to look like one of them. Behind him walked the small group who'd committed to help: Perin, Torin, a handful of refugees, Drenneth's soldiers.

The crowd parted as he passed. Watching. Judging. Skeptical.

Cassian could feel their doubt through the Coin of Heads—waves of skepticism, fear, curiosity. Most expected him to fail. Some hoped he wouldn't. Few believed he had any real chance.

He turned to face them, the King at his side.

"My name is Cassian," he called out, his voice carried and amplified across the plains. "Tomorrow at sunset, I will confront Draven Kane at that mill. If I win, he releases those he's enslaved and surrenders his authority over the Hollow network. If he wins, I surrender my coins and serve his vision."

Murmurs rippled through the crowd.

"I can't defeat him alone," Cassian continued. "Draven has superhuman strength. He draws power from thousands of Hollow, people he's enslaved through deception and broken promises. Against that, I'm just a ledger-keeper with two old relics and no army."

"Then why fight?" someone shouted from the crowd.

"Because someone has to." Cassian's voice was steady. "Because if we don't stand against him now, he'll consume this entire kingdom. Because I believe there's another way to build power—not through theft and coercion, but through willing cooperation."

He paused, letting that settle.

"I'm making an offer. Your strength, your vitality, given to me temporarily during the fight. In exchange, I commit to defending this city with everything I have—to fighting for your freedom, not my own power. The Law will recognize it as a fair trade. Your energy for my service."

Silence spread across the plains. Thousands of people processing what he'd asked.

"This only works if you give freely," Cassian said. "No coercion. No pressure. You can refuse, and I'll fight anyway with whatever strength I have. Or you can accept, and together we'll prove that cooperation can match stolen power."

For a long moment, no one moved. Then voices broke out:

"How do we know you won't just take what we give you and run?"

"Why should we trust some ledger-keeper over the Supreme Voice?"

"My brother joined the Hollow. He says Draven brought him peace. What are you offering?"

Cassian felt the doubt like a physical weight pressing against his chest. These people didn't know him. Had no reason to believe.

Widow Marta pushed through the crowd. "I know him," she called out, her voice firm despite her age. "He corrected the tax records when it cost him his job. Helped my district when no one else cared. He's proven he thinks about more than himself."

"That's one person's word," someone else shouted. "Not enough!"

Cassian's heart sank. He'd hoped for—what? An enthusiastic rush of support? Strangers eager to trust him?

This was reality. Thousands of frightened people being asked to gamble their own strength on someone they barely knew, against an enemy they feared.

Perin stepped forward. "I'll accept your offer, Cassian. My strength to you, for Elena's future."

Through the Coin of Seeds, Cassian felt the connection form—thin, fragile, but real. One person. Just one.

Then Torin: "Mine as well. You freed me. I give you this in return."

Two.

One of the restored refugees: "You gave me pieces of yourself when I had nothing. I offer mine freely."

Three.

Four.

Five.

Twenty.

The ones he'd helped directly—the refugees, tax-burdened citizens from Millhaven, a few merchants who'd witnessed his integrity—they stepped forward one by one. Cassian felt each connection form through the Coin of Seeds, thin threads of trust weaving between them.

But the vast majority of the crowd stood back. Silent. Afraid. Unwilling to commit.

When the movement stopped, Cassian counted perhaps seventy connections. Out of thousands.

It wasn't enough. Not even close to matching Draven's network of ten thousand enslaved Hollow.

"That's your army?" someone mocked from the crowd. "Seventy people? The Supreme Voice has tens of thousands!"

Cassian looked at the seventy people who'd chosen to trust him. The number felt pathetic against the sea of skeptical faces. But it was something. It was real.

"Then I'll fight with seventy," he said, his words carried across the plains. "And pray it's enough."

The King placed a hand on his shoulder. "The offer stays open until tomorrow's fight. When they see what you're willing to sacrifice, more may choose to help." He met Cassian's eyes. "And if they don't—you've still proven that we're different from him."

The crowd began to disperse, most returning to the city unconvinced. Cassian stood watching them go, feeling the weight of seventy fragile connections against Draven's ocean of stolen power.

"The odds are not favorable," Torin said, appearing at his elbow.

"I know."

"You'll likely die."

"I know that too."

"But you're proceeding anyway."

Cassian turned toward the mill, dark against the fading light. "Because maybe seeing me willing to die for them will convince a few more to help. And maybe those few will inspire others. It's a gamble. But it's the only move I have."

Torin studied him for a long moment. "That's either wisdom or foolishness."

"Probably both," Cassian said.

---

They spent the night in final preparations. Torin briefed his team on the Emissary locations. "We sever Veylin and the secondary nodes during the fight. Redirect their tethers temporarily—hold the connections ourselves if we can. While Draven is occupied, we keep those Hollow from feeding him power."

"What happens to them?" one refugee asked. "The ones we disconnect?"

"Confusion. Disorientation. Some will try to reconnect immediately. Some might realize they have a choice and reject Draven entirely. Most will just be lost." Torin's voice was flat. "But lost and chaotic is better than organized and fighting for him. Even if we never restore them, even if they return to being Hollow afterward—it buys Cassian time."

"How much time?"

"Minutes. Maybe less." Torin's expression didn't change. "But that's all we need."

Perin worked with the seventy volunteers, teaching them how to consciously channel vitality through the Coin of Seeds. Most had never attempted anything like it. The transfer exhausted them within minutes.

"This is all we have?" one merchant asked, looking pale and shaken. "Seventy tired people against ten thousand Hollow?"

"It's more than anyone's ever done to oppose him before," Perin said firmly.

Cassian stood alone in the courtyard one last time, both coins burning in his palms. Through the Coin of Heads, he could see the shimmer of value across the city—thousands of people sleeping, most skeptical, fearful, unwilling to commit. And beneath it all, vast and oppressive: Draven's network feeding him power from ten thousand stolen souls.

Seventy connections versus ten thousand.

It wasn't a fight. It was martyrdom.

But maybe martyrdom had value. Maybe his sacrifice would plant seeds that grew into resistance later.

*Some things are worth pursuing even if the world calls you a fool for it.*

His father's words. Rowan had believed them until he died challenging Draven three months ago.

Tomorrow, Cassian would too.

Unless the crowd changed their minds.

---

The next day crawled by. Cassian tried to rest but couldn't. His mind kept returning to Mira—still bound to Draven through the oath she'd sworn. Trapped somewhere in his stronghold, powerless to escape, forced to watch through their connection as he walked toward almost certain death.

The city felt eerily quiet, everyone saving their energy for the spectacle at sunset.

When the time finally came, Cassian walked across the plains toward the mill. The seventy volunteers followed at a distance—a pathetically small group against the backdrop of thousands who'd come to watch.

The crowd was even larger than the night before. Word had spread throughout the capital and beyond. People lined the city walls, filled every inch of open ground, pressed forward for a better view.

Most had come to watch him die.

Cassian reached the mill and turned to face them. "The offer still stands," he called out, his voice amplified across the plains. "Your strength for my service. Given freely, withdrawn freely. I won't force anyone. But you can still choose to fight for freedom."

No one stepped forward. The crowd simply watched, waiting.

Cassian nodded. He'd expected that. But he'd had to try one last time.

He turned toward the mill entrance just as Draven emerged.

The Supreme Voice looked exactly as Cassian remembered—handsome, composed, radiating confidence. A golden locket gleamed at his chest—the caged Coin of Oxen, its black face covered to redirect the cost. A second, smaller locket hung at his belt, the Coin of Waters. Two coins bonded to one man, just like Cassian—but Draven had years more experience.

"Cassian." Draven's voice carried across the plains, warm and measured. "I'm glad you came. Shall we discuss terms like reasonable men?"

"I'm here to fight," Cassian said. "Single combat. The Law as witness. If I win, you release everyone under your Hollow command, including Mira. If you win, I surrender my coins and serve your vision."

Draven's smile widened. "Bold. But you understand what you're up against, don't you? I have ten thousand Hollow feeding me stolen power. You have what? Two medallions and an audience? This isn't a contest, Cassian. It's a public execution."

"Then it should be easy for you."

"It will be." Draven removed his coat casually, handing it to an attendant Cassian hadn't noticed. "The Law recognizes our terms. Single combat. Winner takes all. Shall we begin?"

The Law settled over them both—heavy, binding, absolute. Cassian felt it lock into place like iron chains, making the confrontation inescapable.

He reached through the Coin of Seeds, touching the seventy fragile connections. Thin streams of vitality flowed into him. It wasn't enough, but at least he would be faster and stronger than a normal man.

Against Draven's ocean of stolen power, it felt like bringing a candle to fight the sun.

Draven attacked.

The Coin of Oxen made him impossibly fast—one moment standing still, the next driving a fist toward Cassian's face with enough force to shatter stone.

Cassian moved, enhanced by seventy connections, barely dodging. Draven's fist passed close enough to stir his hair before impacting the mill wall behind him. The wood exploded inward, beams splintering, dust blooming.

The crowd gasped—a collective sound of shock and fear.

Cassian didn't waste time analyzing. He drove forward, channeling borrowed strength into a strike aimed at Draven's ribs. Connected solidly.

Draven barely staggered. "Impressive. You actually touched me." He gestured at the destroyed wall. "But look at what I can do with casual effort. What do you think happens when I actually try?"

He attacked again—faster, more brutal. The plains became a blur of motion. Every strike Draven threw carried lethal force. Every dodge Cassian managed was by the thinnest margin, his enhanced reflexes pushed to their absolute limit.

And slowly, inevitably, Cassian started taking hits.

A glancing blow to his shoulder sent him spinning, pain lancing down his arm. A kick to his ribs cracked bone, drove the air from his lungs. A fist he only partially blocked broke his forearm with a sound like a tree branch snapping.

Cassian collapsed onto the dirt, blood in his mouth, pain screaming through his entire body. The seventy connections poured energy into him, trying to heal the damage, but it wasn't enough. Not nearly enough.

The crowd watched in horrified silence.

This was it. The end. Draven had been right—it wasn't a fight. It was martyrdom.

Draven walked toward him slowly, confident, savoring the moment. "I gave you every chance to avoid this. Every opportunity to serve willingly. But you chose this path. So be it." He raised his fist for the killing blow.

And Cassian felt something shift in the crowd.

Through the Coin of Heads, he sensed it—a ripple of emotion spreading through thousands of people. Not pity exactly. But recognition.

They were watching a man die for them. Seeing the impossible gap between Draven's stolen power and Cassian's seventy volunteers. Witnessing him choose to fight anyway.

One person in the crowd—a merchant Cassian had never met, someone who'd stood silent and skeptical the night before—made a choice. Accepted the trade. Offered their energy freely.

Then another.

And another.

The trickle became a stream. Then a flood.

Cassian felt it through the Coin of Seeds—connections forming by the dozens, then hundreds. People across the plains making split-second decisions to trust him, to give freely, to prove that chosen cooperation could match stolen power.

As Draven's fist descended, power flooded into Cassian like a breaking dam.

His hand shot up and caught Draven's fist—stopped it cold. The impact sent shockwaves across the plains, cracking the ground beneath them, but Cassian held firm. The vast wellspring of energy flowing into him knitted his broken bones, healed his injuries, filled him with strength he'd never imagined.

Draven's eyes widened in genuine shock. "How—"

Cassian rose to his feet, Draven's fist still caught in his grip. "Because they chose to believe in me. Because they believe in freedom."

He twisted, throwing Draven backward with force that made the ground crack. The Supreme Voice tumbled across the dirt, stunned, off-balance for the first time in the fight.

Through the Coin of Seeds, Cassian could feel thousands of connections now—a vast network of people freely offering their strength. Not stolen. Given.

For the first time since the fight began, fear flickered across Draven's face.

The real fight had just begun.
