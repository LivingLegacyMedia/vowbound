# Chapter 16: Severance

The cell was cold stone and iron bars, ten feet square, smelling of rust and fear. No windows. A single torch in the hallway beyond cast shadows that crawled across the walls.

Cassian woke slowly, consciousness returning in fragments like broken glass being swept back together. His wrists were raw where ropes had been replaced with manacles. His shoulder throbbed where the club had struck. But worse than the physical pain was the hollowness in his chest—an ache that had nothing to do with the tethers he'd held and everything to do with what was missing.

The coins were gone.

He could still feel them, distantly. Like phantom limbs. The Coin of Heads pulsed somewhere to the north—perhaps a hundred yards away, held in some secure location. The Coin of Seeds hummed with muted energy in the same direction. The bonds weren't severed, but they were stretched thin, barely holding.

*How much power do I have without them?* The thought surfaced through his fragmented awareness. *Can I still access the gray space? Can I still negotiate?*

He tried to enter the Silent Market—that space between spaces where value became visible. His awareness shifted, but only partially. The gray space flickered around him, unstable and incomplete. He could perceive threads of value in the iron bars, sense the worth of the torch flame, but everything was muted. Distant. Like trying to see through fog.

*I can still access it,* he realized with a mixture of relief and dread. *But barely. Without the coins in my possession, I'm operating at maybe ten percent capacity.*

"You're awake." Mira's voice, rough and tired, came from the adjacent cell. Iron bars separated them. She sat against the far wall, one eye swollen shut, dried blood crusted on her lip. "Took you long enough."

"How long have I been unconscious?"

"Three hours. Maybe four." She shifted, chains clinking. "Perin woke up an hour ago. Torin hasn't moved since they threw him in."

Cassian looked across the hallway. Two more cells faced his. Perin sat in one, his head in his hands, shoulders shaking with silent sobs. In the other, Torin lay motionless on the stone floor, eyes open but unseeing—retreated so far into his damaged consciousness that he might as well be hollow again.

"They took the coins," Cassian said quietly.

"I know. I watched them wrap them in leather like they were handling live snakes." Mira touched her swollen eye gingerly. "The guard who tried to grab the coin directly? His hand blistered so badly they had to wrap it in wet cloth. Whatever bond you have with those things, it doesn't break easily."

"But it can be broken." Cassian closed his eyes, feeling the distant pulse of both coins. "If they study them long enough. Figure out how to sever the connection forcefully."

"Then what? They bond to someone else?"

"Maybe. Or they become inert. Or..." Cassian trailed off, not wanting to voice the darker possibilities. What happened when their bond was forcibly severed? Would the backlash destroy him? Would it destroy whoever tried to take them?

Footsteps echoed in the hallway.

Two guards appeared, flanking a woman in gray robes. She carried a leather satchel and moved with the precise confidence of someone who knew she was perfectly safe.

"Cassian." Her voice was cold, clinical. "I'm Administrator Veylin. I oversee security operations for the Merchant's Relief Society. We have questions."

She gestured, and the guards unlocked his cell door, stepping inside with clubs ready. Cassian didn't resist as they hauled him upright, manacles clinking. His legs barely supported his weight.

"Where are the other converts you freed?" Veylin asked without preamble. "The eight who escaped. Where would they go?"

Cassian said nothing.

"We've already recaptured three of them," she continued conversationally. "Found hiding in grain cellars and under market stalls. We're working on convincing them to return to the network. The process is quite unpleasant when they resist—we have methods."

Cassian's stomach turned, but he kept his face neutral.

"The other five are still out there. Damaged. Terrified. Alone." Veylin stepped closer. "You freed them, but you can't protect them. They'll be caught within days—maybe hours. But if you tell us where they're likely hiding, we can make the process of bringing them back more... efficient."

"Why would you do that?"

"Because damaged converts are less useful." She spoke like she was discussing crop yields. "A convert who resists and must be broken takes weeks to become functional again. But one who agrees to return? Immediate integration. It's simply better business."

"You're not getting anything from me."

Veylin sighed. "I expected as much. Still, I had to try the reasonable approach first." She nodded to the guards. "Proceed."

One guard grabbed Cassian's manacled wrists and yanked them upward, forcing him to his knees. The other drew a thin metal rod from his belt—not a club, but something designed for precision pain.

"Let's start with something simple," Veylin said. "Your accomplice. The girl in the next cell. How long have you known her?"

Cassian gritted his teeth. "Go to hell."

The rod struck his ribs—not hard enough to break bone, but precise enough to light every nerve ending on fire. He gasped, vision blurring.

"How long have you known her?" Veylin repeated.

"Weeks. I don't... I don't know exactly."

"And where did you meet?"

Another strike. Higher this time, just below the shoulder. Cassian's mind tried to retreat into the gray space, seeking refuge, but without the coins in hand he couldn't fully enter. He was trapped in his body, feeling everything.

"Where did you meet?" Veylin asked again, her tone unchanged.

From the adjacent cell, Mira's voice rang out: "Leave him alone, you bitch!"

Veylin barely glanced at her. "I'll get to you next. Patience."

The interrogation continued. Questions about safe houses, contacts in the city, other members of the Unhollow. Cassian answered when he could without endangering anyone, stayed silent when he couldn't, and took the punishment for both.

The metal rod found his kidneys. His shoulders. The backs of his knees. Each strike was carefully measured—enough pain to motivate answers, not enough damage to render him unconscious. Veylin was practiced at this.

After what felt like hours, she finally stepped back. "Enough for now. We'll resume in the morning when you've had time to reconsider cooperation."

The guards shoved Cassian back against the wall and left, locking the cell behind them. Veylin paused at the door.

"One more thing," she said. "The coins. We're studying them in research wing. Our specialists are trying to understand the bond. If you'd like to avoid the rather unpleasant experience of having that bond tested, I suggest you become more forthcoming in our next session."

She left.

Cassian lay on the cold stone, every muscle aching. His fragmented thoughts tried to process what he'd learned. The coins were in the north wing. Studied by specialists.

"Cassian?" Mira's voice, quieter now. "You alive?"

"Barely."

"They'll come for the rest of us next. Try to get information about who else might be helping you."

"I know."

"I won't tell them anything."

"I know that too." Cassian shifted, trying to find a position that didn't make everything hurt worse. "But you don't have to take their torture. If they ask something that won't endanger anyone, just answer. Save yourself the pain."

"Same logic applies to you."

"I can't. I know too much." He closed his eyes. "I know where the safe houses are. Who's helping. Where Elena is hiding."

The name hung in the air. Perin's daughter. The eight-year-old girl who'd watched them all get captured.

From across the hall, Perin's voice emerged, broken and raw: "She saw it happen. She was supposed to stay hidden, but she followed us. She saw everything."

"She's smart," Cassian said. "She'll stay safe."

"She's eight." Perin's voice cracked. "And she just watched them take me again. After you saved me. After I thought... after we thought..."

"We tried," Mira said firmly. "We freed eight people. Maybe more, if the eleven damaged ones can rebuild themselves."

"And how many got recaptured?" Perin's laugh was bitter. "How many died? I saw that woman's head hit the stone. She wasn't moving after."

"We did what we could."

"We got ourselves captured and handed Draven two more weapons!" Perin shouted, chains rattling as he stood. "We gave him exactly what he wanted while accomplishing nothing!"

Silence fell, heavy and damning.

Because Perin was right. They'd freed a handful of people at the cost of losing the coins and getting captured. Draven was stronger now, and they were locked in cells, broken and helpless.

Cassian tried to access the gray space again, searching for any thread he could pull, any value he could trade. The space flickered around him, unstable. He could perceive the iron bars—worth perhaps two silver coins for the metal. The torch flame—worth the oil that fed it. The stone walls—worth the labor that had shaped them.

But without the coins in hand, he couldn't make significant trades. Couldn't negotiate with the Law. Couldn't bargain for their freedom.

*Unless...*

The thought surfaced slowly, like something rising from deep water.

The coins were still bonded to him. Still connected. The link was stretched thin, but it existed. Which meant they were still *his* in the eyes of the Law, even if he didn't physically possess them.

What if he could use them remotely?

Cassian focused on the distant pulse of the Coin of Heads. He reached out through the bond, trying to extend his awareness along that thread of connection. The effort was like trying to lift a boulder with frayed rope—the link kept slipping, his focus fragmenting.

But after several minutes of intense concentration, something shifted.

His perspective lurched sideways, and suddenly he was seeing through different eyes.

A laboratory. Well-lit by multiple lanterns. Tables covered with instruments—scales, calipers, hammers, chisels. And in the center, on a cushion of black velvet, lay both coins.

Two robed figures stood over them, taking notes and conducting tests.

Cassian's awareness stabilized, anchoring to the Coin of Heads' perspective. He could see the room, hear the sounds, perceive the value in everything around him. But it was like watching through a thick window—he could observe but not interact.

One figure picked up the Coin of Heads carefully, using thick leather gloves. Even through the protection, the person winced. "Still warm. The bond is remarkably persistent."

The other figure was writing. "We've tried several approaches, but they all produce feedback. The one time we attempted forced severance, the temperature spiked dramatically. Nearly set fire to the table."

"These aren't ordinary artifacts. The bonding mechanism is deeply embedded." The first figure set the coin down carefully. "Severing the connection might harm both the artifact and the bearer."

"Does he still have access to their power? Even locked in a cell?"

"Unknown. His awareness seems fragmented from what he did at the warehouse. But if he recovers..." A pause. "We should monitor for any unusual activity."

Cassian pulled his awareness back before they noticed anything. He couldn't risk them detecting his observation.

Which meant attempting any trade was playing directly into Draven's hands.

But what choice did they have? Without the coins' power, they had no way to escape. The cell bars were too strong. The guards too numerous. And Veylin would be back in the morning with her questions and her metal rod.

*I need to think this through,* Cassian told himself. *Need to find an approach Draven won't expect.*

His awareness snapped back to his body with nauseating abruptness. The cell solidified around him. The pain returned in full force.

"You all right?" Mira asked. "You were gone for a minute there. Staring at nothing."

"I can still reach them," Cassian said quietly. "The coins. I can see through their perspective. But I can't use them properly. Not from this distance, not with the bond stretched so thin."

"So we're stuck."

"For now." Cassian shifted carefully, testing which parts of his body hurt least. "The coins are in the north wing."

"Can you reach them from here?"

"Barely. I can observe through them, but using their power remotely is costly. Inefficient." He opened his eyes. "But if I could get closer, get them back in my possession..."

"That's insane. You can barely stand."

"I know." Cassian opened his eyes, looking at her through the bars. "But I don't see another option. Veylin will be back tomorrow. She'll escalate the interrogation. Eventually, I'll break or she'll kill me trying. Either way, we lose."

"What about the King? Won't he try to rescue us?"

"Maybe. But if he does, it'll be a political nightmare. The Relief Society will claim we committed crimes, that the King is overreaching, that he's protecting criminals." Cassian shook his head. "And even if he tries, Draven will have contingencies. We can't count on rescue."

From across the hall, Torin finally stirred. His voice emerged, flat and distant: "The building layout. Three floors. We're on the ground level. North wing is second floor—I saw it when they brought us in. Two staircases. Guard rotation every three hours."

Everyone turned to look at him. Torin hadn't spoken since they'd been captured.

"You've been listening?" Mira asked.

"Always listening." Torin sat up slowly, movements mechanical. "It's easier than feeling. Listening. Cataloging." His eyes focused on Cassian. "You want to reach the north wing. Steal the third coin. But you can't access your coins' power from this distance, and you can't walk through walls."

"I know."

"So you need to get closer." Torin stood, chains clinking. "Close enough that the bond strengthens. Close enough to actually use them."

"Which means escaping these cells first. Which I can't do without the coins." Cassian laughed bitterly. "It's circular logic. A trap."

"Not if you change the terms." Torin moved to the bars, gripping them with both hands. "You've been thinking like a prisoner. Bars. Guards. Locked doors. All obstacles."

"They are obstacles."

"They're also value." Torin's expression didn't change, but something shifted in his tone. "Everything is value. You taught me that. The iron in these bars—worth something. The guards' time—worth something. The very fact that we're imprisoned—worth something to Draven."

Cassian felt understanding bloom slowly. "I can't make big trades from here. But I can make small ones."

"Very small ones," Torin agreed. "Precise ones. The kind that look like nothing but change everything."

Mira leaned forward. "What are you two talking about?"

"The Law of Balance doesn't require possession," Cassian said slowly, his fragmented thoughts suddenly crystallizing. "It requires connection. I'm still bonded to the coins, which means I can still negotiate. Just... smaller. More carefully."

He closed his eyes again, reaching for the distant pulse of the Coin of Heads. This time he didn't try to use its power. He just asked a question.

*What is the value of this iron bar?*

The answer came back, faint but clear: *Two silver coins in raw material. Three silver for forged work. But currently holding four prisoners—value to Draven approximately twenty gold coins each, total eighty gold.*

*And what if the value of imprisonment decreased?*

The Law considered. *The value of imprisonment is measured by security. Reduce security, reduce value.*

Cassian opened his eyes. "The hinges. On these cell doors. They're old iron, poorly maintained. If I could trade away a tiny fraction of their structural integrity—make them just slightly weaker—"

"They'd still hold," Mira finished. "But one good kick might break them."

"Except I can't kick hard enough from this condition." Cassian gestured to his battered body. "Not without help."

All eyes turned to Perin. The carpenter sat slumped in his cell, but his shoulders were still broad. His arms still carried the strength of years hauling timber and swinging hammers.

"You want me to kick down the door?" Perin asked incredulously.

"After I weaken the hinges, yes."

"And then what? We fight our way through dozens of guards?"

"No." Cassian's mind was working faster now, pieces falling into place. "We create a distraction. Make them think we're trying to escape through the front entrance. While they're focused there, we slip up to the north wing, I grab the coins, and we leave through a window."

"That's the plan? That's your brilliant escape strategy?"

"It's insane," Mira agreed.

"It's also our only option," Torin said flatly. "Morning comes in five hours. Veylin returns. Interrogation escalates. Within two days, they'll have extracted everything useful and we'll either be killed or converted." His damaged expression somehow managed to convey certainty. "We try this now or we don't try at all."

Perin was quiet for a long moment. Then he stood, moving to his cell door. "Fine. Let's be insane together. Better than sitting here waiting to die."

Cassian felt a surge of gratitude. "Thank you."

"Thank me when we're not captured anymore." Perin tested the door, pushing experimentally. "These bars. Can you get rid of them?"

"I can't remove them or weaken them. Not enough to matter." Cassian reached for the Coin of Heads again, focusing on Perin's cell door lock. "But I might be able to trade for something that would heplu  a key."

He entered the gray space—barely, just enough to perceive the value threads. The lock was simple iron, worth perhaps two copper coins. Its value was in keeping Perin contained. The tumblers inside had a specific configuration.

Cassian spoke carefully to the Law: "I offer this trade. I'll pay with my own vitality—two weeks of my natural lifespan. In exchange, create a key that matches this lock. A precise duplicate of the pattern needed to open it."

The Law considered. It was a specific request, small in scope but requiring precision. Two weeks of life for a shaped piece of metal that matched an existing pattern. 

The exchange was inefficient—Cassian was overpaying. Making trades remotely, with the coins so distant, cost more than it should. His mind was still weary from holding the tethers, and it made every transaction harder.

But the Law accepted.

Value flowed out of Cassian—two weeks of his life, measured in heartbeats and breaths and potential moments. In his hand, metal began to form—drawn from the very bars of his own cell, reshaped atom by atom. A key materialized, warm and solid against his palm.

It cost him dearly. He felt the vitality drain, felt his already fragmented mind grow hazier. But it worked.

"Here." Cassian passed the key through the bars to Perin. "Try it."

Perin took the key with shaking hands and inserted it into his lock. It turned smoothly. The cell door swung open.

"Free the rest of us," Cassian said. "Quickly and quietly."

Perin moved to Mira's cell first, then Torin's, then Cassian's. The locks opened with barely a sound. Within moments, all four stood in the hallway, chains still binding their wrists but cells open.

"The keys," Mira whispered. "We need the guard's keys to get these chains off."

They moved quietly down the hallway. The guard station was around the corner—Cassian could sense it through the gray space. Two guards, both drowsy, near the end of their shift.

Perin picked up a fallen piece of wood from a broken crate. He looked at Cassian, who nodded.

They rounded the corner fast.

The first guard barely had time to look up before Perin's makeshift club caught him across the temple. He crumpled. The second guard opened his mouth to shout, but Torin—moving with surprising speed—grabbed a chair and brought it down on the man's shoulders. The guard stumbled, and Mira finished him with a swift kick to the back of the knee, then an elbow to the head as he fell.

Perin grabbed the key ring from the first guard's belt. Within seconds, they'd removed their manacles, wrists finally free.

"Now we need to move," Cassian said. "Before someone checks on them."

"The north wing," Mira said. "Get your coins and get out."

They moved quickly down the hallway, trying to stay quiet. Torin led them—his cataloging mind providing navigation despite everything. Every turn, every stairwell, every landmark he'd memorized during their capture.

Up the stairs to the second floor. Still quiet. The late hour working in their favor.

"North wing is this way," Torin whispered. "Last door on the left."

They moved down the hallway. Cassian's legs burned. His vision blurred. Every step was difficult, but they were making progress.

Behind them, a shout. Someone had found the unconscious guards.

"Run!" Mira hissed.

They sprinted the last thirty feet. Behind them, boots thundered on the stairs.

The door at the end of the hall was locked.

Perin threw himself against it—once, twice. On the third impact, the wood splintered. They crashed through into the laboratory.

Lanterns blazed. Tables full of instruments. And there, on black velvet—

Both coins.

Cassian lunged for them, hands outstretched.

The moment his fingers touched the Coin of Heads, power flooded back like a dam breaking. The bond snapped taut, fully reconnected, and suddenly he was complete again. The gray space opened around him in full clarity. Value threads blazed throughout the room.

He grabbed the Coin of Seeds with his other hand, and growth energy surged through his battered body. Not healing—he didn't have time for that—but potential. The promise that healing could happen. That growth could resume.

"Finally," he breathed.

Guards crashed through the door behind them.

Cassian turned, both coins burning in his palms. Six guards filled the doorway, clubs and swords drawn. He entered the gray space fully, seeing them as bundles of value—their strength, their will, their consciousness.

Now that the coins were back in his possession, his mind felt sharper. Clearer. The fragmentation from holding the tethers was still there, but muted. He could think again.

He scanned the room rapidly. Tables full of instruments. Scales, calipers, measuring devices—all valuable. Glass vials filled with reagents. And there, on the corner desk, a leather pouch. Money. Research funding.

Cassian reached into the gray space and grasped the value of the coins in that pouch—approximately thirty gold pieces, he sensed. Enough to pay a craftsman for months. Enough to compensate six guards for letting prisoners escape.

"I offer this trade," he said quickly. "The gold in that pouch goes to these six guards, divided equally. In exchange, they step aside and let us leave."

The Law considered. Five gold coins per guard to allow four prisoners to escape? Fair compensation. The guards were being paid to stop them, but this was better pay than their employers offered.

The Law accepted.

All six guards felt the transaction complete in their minds. The leather pouch on the desk now contained their payment—five gold coins each, legally theirs through the Law's recognition. They were no longer being paid to stop the escape. They'd been paid to allow it.

Five of the six immediately stepped aside, looking somewhat dazed but satisfied with the unexpected windfall.

The sixth—a woman with fierce eyes and a scar across her chin—shook her head. "I don't want your blood money. You're not leaving."

Cassian respected that. "Then I'm sorry."

He pulled from the value of her wakefulness—a small theft, quick and precise. The woman's eyes rolled back and she collapsed, unconscious.

It cost him three days of his life. Painful, but not devastating.

"Window!" Mira pointed to the far wall. "Now!"

They ran to it. Cassian looked down. Twenty feet to the alley below. Cobblestones. A potentially deadly drop.

"Wait," he said, his mind working quickly. The coins were back in his hands. He could think clearly again, see solutions.

He turned back to the laboratory, scanning the tables. Glass vials. Reagents. Scales. And there—bundles of dried herbs hanging from the ceiling. Medicinal plants, valuable for their healing properties.

But among them, he could sense something more useful. Seeds. Herb seeds stored in small cloth pouches for planting in the spring.

Cassian grabbed three pouches from the shelf, feeling their contents through the gray space. Hearty climbing vines. Fast-growing ground cover. Perfect.

"What are you doing?" Mira hissed.

"Something we'd better hope will work." Cassian opened the pouches and scattered the seeds out the window, letting them fall to the alley below. Then he held up the Coin of Seeds.

He spoke to the Law: "I offer this trade. The value of those expensive laboratory instruments on the center table—transferred to accelerate the growth of these seeds. Fair exchange for rapid growth."

The Law considered. Laboratory equipment for accelerated plant growth? The values were roughly equivalent. The exchange was clean.

The Law accepted.

The instruments on the table tarnished, aged, became brittle—their value drained. And in the alley below, the scattered seeds erupted into life.

Vines shot upward at impossible speed, thick woody stems reaching for the window. Within seconds, a lattice of vegetation covered the wall—cushioning, climbing holds, a living ladder.

And it had cost Cassian nothing but stolen property.

"Down!" he called. "Quickly!"

They descended—Torin first, moving mechanically but efficiently. Then Mira, then Perin. Cassian came last, feeling stronger than he had minutes ago, his mind clearer with the coins back in his possession.

The vines held.

The four climbers reached the ground as shouts erupted from the window above.

Cassian's feet hit solid ground. The coins burned in his grip, still connected, still his. And he'd escaped without trading away more of his own life—just stolen property and laboratory equipment.

Small victories.

"Move!" Mira dragged him upright. "They'll be right behind us!"

They ran into the maze of alleys, leaving the Merchant's Relief Society facility behind. Cassian could hear shouting. Boots on cobblestones. But they had a head start.

"Where do we go?" Perin gasped as they rounded a corner.

"Anywhere but here," Cassian managed. "Split up. Meet at—" He thought quickly, his mind sharper now. "The old mill outside the eastern gate. Tomorrow night, two hours after sunset."

"That's your plan?" Mira demanded. "Split up and hope we all survive?"

"Better than staying together and leading them straight to us." Cassian looked at each of them. "Two hours after sunset, tomorrow. The old mill. If anyone doesn't make it, we wait one more night. After that, we assume the worst."

She nodded, grim but understanding.

They reached an intersection and scattered—Mira disappearing south, Perin east, Torin west. Cassian stumbled north, clutching both coins, feeling them pulse with heat against his chest.

He'd reclaimed his power. They'd escaped. And he'd done it without hemorrhaging his own vitality this time.

Behind him, more shouts. More boots. The hunt was on.

Cassian ran, vanishing into the shadows, already planning his next move.

---

In the wreckage of the laboratory, Administrator Veylin examined the shattered window and the unconscious guards with barely contained fury.

"Find them," she ordered the search teams. "All four. I want this facility locked down and every exit watched."

"Ma'am, they have at least a five-minute head start. They could be anywhere in the city by now."

"Then search the city." Veylin turned to survey the damage—broken glass, scattered notes, the cushion where the coins had rested now empty, instruments on the center table corroded and worthless. "And send word to our contacts. I want the recaptured converts moved to a more secure location immediately. If Cassian freed them once, he'll try again."

"What about the King? Will he intervene?"

"Unknown. But we need to act as if he might." Veylin moved to the desk, gathering the research notes that remained. "Send word to the council. Frame this correctly—four criminals assaulted our guards and stole valuable artifacts. If the King tries to protect them, he's harboring thieves."

"And if they come back for the converts we recaptured?"

"Then we'll be ready." Veylin's expression hardened. "Double the guards. Set traps. Make it impossible for them to try another rescue without walking into certain capture."

She looked out the window at the dark city. Somewhere out there, Cassian was running. Wounded. Desperate. 

"He'll come back," she said quietly. "He won't be able to help himself. And when he does, we'll finish this."

---

Cassian collapsed in an alley three blocks away, lungs burning, legs giving out. He clutched both coins to his chest, feeling them pulse in sync with his racing heart.

He'd escaped. They'd all escaped.

But eight people they'd freed were back in the Hollow's hands. The unconscious guards would wake with questions. And the Society now knew he could use the coins remotely, even if the connection was weak.

*We're still losing,* Cassian thought. *But at least this time I didn't lose too much of myself.*

The coins burned against his skin, still connected, still his.

He could work with this.

He had to.
