# Chapter 16: Severance

The cell was cold stone and iron bars, ten feet square, smelling of rust and fear. No windows. A single torch in the hallway beyond cast shadows that crawled across the walls.

Cassian woke slowly, consciousness returning in fragments like broken glass being swept back together. His wrists were raw where ropes had been replaced with manacles. His shoulder throbbed where the club had struck. But worse than the physical pain was the hollowness in his chest—an ache that had nothing to do with the tethers he'd held and everything to do with what was missing.

The coins were gone.

He could still feel them, distantly. Like phantom limbs. The Coin of Heads pulsed somewhere to the north—perhaps a hundred yards away, held in some secure location. The Coin of Seeds hummed with muted energy in the same direction. The bonds weren't severed, but they were stretched thin, barely holding.

*How much power do I have without them?* The thought surfaced through his fragmented awareness. *Can I still access the gray space? Can I still negotiate?*

He tried to enter the Silent Market—that space between spaces where value became visible. His awareness shifted, but only partially. The gray space flickered around him, unstable and incomplete. He could perceive threads of value in the iron bars, sense the worth of the torch flame, but everything was muted. Distant. Like trying to see through fog.

*I can still access it,* he realized with a mixture of relief and dread. *But barely. Without the coins in my possession, I'm operating at maybe ten percent capacity.*

"You're awake." Mira's voice, rough and tired, came from the adjacent cell. Iron bars separated them. She sat against the far wall, one eye swollen shut, dried blood crusted on her lip. "Took you long enough."

"How long have I been unconscious?"

"Three hours. Maybe four." She shifted, chains clinking. "Perin woke up an hour ago. Torin hasn't moved since they threw him in."

Cassian looked across the hallway. Two more cells faced his. Perin sat in one, his head in his hands, shoulders shaking with silent sobs. In the other, Torin lay motionless on the stone floor, eyes open but unseeing—retreated so far into his damaged consciousness that he might as well be hollow again.

"They took the coins," Cassian said quietly.

"I know. I watched them wrap them in leather like they were handling live snakes." Mira touched her swollen eye gingerly. "The guard who tried to grab the coin directly? His hand blistered so badly they had to wrap it in wet cloth. Whatever bond you have with those things, it doesn't break easily."

"But it can be broken." Cassian closed his eyes, feeling the distant pulse of both coins. "If they study them long enough. Figure out how to sever the connection forcefully."

"Then what? They bond to someone else?"

"Maybe. Or they become inert. Or..." Cassian trailed off, not wanting to voice the darker possibilities. What happened when their bond was forcibly severed? Would the backlash destroy him? Would it destroy whoever tried to take them?

Footsteps echoed in the hallway.

Two guards appeared, flanking a woman in gray robes. She carried a leather satchel and moved with the precise confidence of someone who knew she was perfectly safe.

"Cassian." Her voice was cold, clinical. "I'm Administrator Veylin. I oversee security operations for the Merchant's Relief Society. We have questions."

She gestured, and the guards unlocked his cell door, stepping inside with clubs ready. Cassian didn't resist as they hauled him upright, manacles clinking. His legs barely supported his weight.

"Where are the other converts you freed?" Veylin asked without preamble. "The eight who escaped. Where would they go?"

Cassian said nothing.

"We've already recaptured three of them," she continued conversationally. "Found hiding in grain cellars and under market stalls. They're being re-integrated into the network as we speak. The process is quite painful when done forcibly—much worse than the original conversion. I'm told the screaming lasts for hours."

Cassian's stomach turned, but he kept his face neutral.

"The other five are still out there. Damaged. Terrified. Alone." Veylin stepped closer. "You freed them, but you can't protect them. They'll be caught within days—maybe hours. But if you tell us where they're likely hiding, we can make the re-integration less... traumatic."

"Why would you do that?"

"Because trauma reduces efficiency." She spoke like she was discussing crop yields. "A convert who's been forcibly re-integrated performs at sixty percent capacity for months. But one who returns willingly, who accepts the emptiness again? Full functionality within days. It's simply better business."

"You're not getting anything from me."

Veylin sighed. "I expected as much. Still, I had to try the reasonable approach first." She nodded to the guards. "Proceed."

One guard grabbed Cassian's manacled wrists and yanked them upward, forcing him to his knees. The other drew a thin metal rod from his belt—not a club, but something designed for precision pain.

"Let's start with something simple," Veylin said. "Your accomplice. The girl in the next cell. How long have you known her?"

Cassian gritted his teeth. "Go to hell."

The rod struck his ribs—not hard enough to break bone, but precise enough to light every nerve ending on fire. He gasped, vision blurring.

"How long have you known her?" Veylin repeated.

"Weeks. I don't... I don't know exactly."

"And where did you meet?"

Another strike. Higher this time, just below the shoulder. Cassian's mind tried to retreat into the gray space, seeking refuge, but without the coins in hand he couldn't fully enter. He was trapped in his body, feeling everything.

"Where did you meet?" Veylin asked again, her tone unchanged.

From the adjacent cell, Mira's voice rang out: "Leave him alone, you bitch!"

Veylin barely glanced at her. "I'll get to you next. Patience."

The interrogation continued. Questions about safe houses, contacts in the city, other members of the Unhollow. Cassian answered when he could without endangering anyone, stayed silent when he couldn't, and took the punishment for both.

The metal rod found his kidneys. His shoulders. The soft tissue behind his knees. Each strike was carefully measured—enough pain to motivate answers, not enough damage to render him unconscious. Veylin was very good at her job.

After what felt like hours, she finally stepped back. "Enough for now. We'll resume in the morning when you've had time to reconsider cooperation."

The guards shoved Cassian back against the wall and left, locking the cell behind them. Veylin paused at the door.

"One more thing," she said. "The coins. We're studying them in the north wing. Draven himself is examining them, trying to understand the bond. If you'd like to avoid the rather unpleasant experience of having that bond forcibly severed, I suggest you become more forthcoming in our next session."

She left.

Cassian lay on the cold stone, every muscle screaming. His fragmented thoughts tried to process what he'd learned. Draven was here. In Arvenstead. Studying the coins personally.

"Cassian?" Mira's voice, quieter now. "You alive?"

"Barely."

"They'll come for the rest of us next. Try to get information about who else might be helping you."

"I know."

"I won't tell them anything."

"I know that too." Cassian shifted, trying to find a position that didn't make everything hurt worse. "But you don't have to take their torture. If they ask something that won't endanger anyone, just answer. Save yourself the pain."

"Same logic applies to you."

"I can't. I know too much." He closed his eyes. "I know where the safe houses are. Who's helping. Where Elena is hiding."

The name hung in the air. Perin's daughter. The eight-year-old girl who'd watched them all get captured.

From across the hall, Perin's voice emerged, broken and raw: "She saw it happen. She was supposed to stay hidden, but she followed us. She saw everything."

"She's smart," Cassian said. "She'll stay safe."

"She's eight." Perin's voice cracked. "And she just watched them take me again. After you saved me. After I thought... after we thought..."

"We tried," Mira said firmly. "We freed eight people. Maybe more, if the eleven damaged ones can rebuild themselves."

"And how many got recaptured?" Perin's laugh was bitter. "How many died? I saw that woman's head hit the stone. She wasn't moving after."

"We did what we could."

"We got ourselves captured and handed Draven two more weapons!" Perin shouted, chains rattling as he stood. "We gave him exactly what he wanted while accomplishing nothing!"

Silence fell, heavy and damning.

Because Perin was right. They'd freed a handful of people at the cost of losing the coins and getting captured. Draven was stronger now, and they were locked in cells, broken and helpless.

Cassian tried to access the gray space again, searching for any thread he could pull, any value he could trade. The space flickered around him, unstable. He could perceive the iron bars—worth perhaps two silver coins for the metal. The torch flame—worth the oil that fed it. The stone walls—worth the labor that had shaped them.

But without the coins in hand, he couldn't make significant trades. Couldn't negotiate with the Law. Couldn't bargain for their freedom.

*Unless...*

The thought surfaced slowly, like something rising from deep water.

The coins were still bonded to him. Still connected. The link was stretched thin, but it existed. Which meant they were still *his* in the eyes of the Law, even if he didn't physically possess them.

What if he could use them remotely?

Cassian focused on the distant pulse of the Coin of Heads. He reached out through the bond, trying to extend his awareness along that thread of connection. The effort was like trying to lift a boulder with frayed rope—the link kept slipping, his focus fragmenting.

But after several minutes of intense concentration, something shifted.

His perspective lurched sideways, and suddenly he was seeing through different eyes.

A laboratory. Well-lit by multiple lanterns. Tables covered with instruments—scales, calipers, hammers, chisels. And in the center, on a cushion of black velvet, lay both coins.

Draven Kane stood over them, studying intently.

Cassian's awareness stabilized, anchoring to the Coin of Heads' perspective. He could see the room, hear the sounds, perceive the value in everything around him. But it was like watching through a thick window—he could observe but not interact.

Draven picked up the Coin of Heads carefully, using thick leather gloves. Even through the protection, his expression tightened. "Still burning. Even after hours separated from him."

An assistant stood nearby, taking notes. "The bond is remarkably resilient. We've tried several severance techniques, but they all produce dangerous feedback. The one time we attempted forced dissolution, the coin's temperature increased by fifty degrees in seconds. Nearly melted through the table."

"Because it's not just magic. It's angelic artifice." Draven turned the coin over, examining the symbols. "These were never meant to change hands easily. The Equitors designed them to bond completely—severing the connection might destroy both the coin and the bearer."

"Then he still has access to them? Even locked in a cell?"

"Potentially. Though I doubt he realizes it yet." Draven set the coin down carefully. "His awareness is too fragmented from holding those tethers. But once he recovers..." 

"Should we keep them separated? Make it harder for him to—"

"No. I want to see what he tries." Draven smiled. "Let him reach for them remotely. Let him attempt trades from his cell. It will teach us the true limits of the bond."

Cassian felt a chill. Draven *wanted* him to try using the coins. Wanted to study what happened when he did.

Which meant attempting any trade was playing directly into Draven's hands.

But what choice did they have? Without the coins' power, they had no way to escape. The cell bars were too strong. The guards too numerous. And Veylin would be back in the morning with her questions and her metal rod.

*I need to think this through,* Cassian told himself. *Need to find an approach Draven won't expect.*

His awareness snapped back to his body with nauseating abruptness. The cell solidified around him. The pain returned in full force.

"You all right?" Mira asked. "You were gone for a minute there. Staring at nothing."

"I can still reach them," Cassian said quietly. "The coins. I can see through their perspective. But I can't use them properly. Not from this distance, not with the bond stretched so thin."

"So we're stuck."

"For now." Cassian shifted carefully, testing which parts of his body hurt least. "But Draven's studying them personally. He's here in the city, probably in this building. Which means the Coin of Oxen is here too."

Mira went very still. "You're thinking of trying to take it?"

"I'm thinking we need leverage. Right now we have none." Cassian closed his eyes, feeling the distant pulse of all three coins—his two, stretched thin across a hundred yards, and Draven's, somewhere even farther north. "If I could reach the Coin of Oxen. Bond to it, even temporarily..."

"You'd have what? Strength? Power?"

"Control over strength and power," Cassian corrected. "The ability to trade for it. To grant it or drain it." His thoughts were starting to cohere, fragments knitting back together. "I could make the guards weak enough to overpower. Make the bars brittle enough to break. Make ourselves strong enough to run."

"That's insane. You can barely stand."

"I know." Cassian opened his eyes, looking at her through the bars. "But I don't see another option. Veylin will be back tomorrow. She'll escalate the interrogation. Eventually, I'll break or she'll kill me trying. Either way, we lose."

"What about the King? Won't he try to rescue us?"

"Maybe. But if he does, it'll be a political nightmare. The Relief Society will claim we committed crimes, that the King is overreaching, that he's protecting criminals." Cassian shook his head. "And even if he tries, Draven will have contingencies. We can't count on rescue."

From across the hall, Torin finally stirred. His voice emerged, flat and distant: "The building layout. Three floors. We're on the ground level. North wing is second floor—I saw it when they brought us in. Two staircases. Guard rotation every three hours."

Everyone turned to look at him. Torin hadn't spoken since they'd been captured.

"You've been listening?" Mira asked.

"Always listening." Torin sat up slowly, movements mechanical. "It's easier than feeling. Listening. Cataloging." His eyes focused on Cassian. "You want to reach the north wing. Steal the third coin. But you can't access your coins' power from this distance, and you can't walk through walls."

"I know."

"So you need to get closer." Torin stood, chains clinking. "Close enough that the bond strengthens. Close enough to actually use them."

"Which means escaping these cells first. Which I can't do without the coins." Cassian laughed bitterly. "It's circular logic. A trap."

"Not if you change the terms." Torin moved to the bars, gripping them with both hands. "You've been thinking like a prisoner. Bars. Guards. Locked doors. All obstacles."

"They are obstacles."

"They're also value." Torin's expression didn't change, but something shifted in his tone. "Everything is value. You taught me that. The iron in these bars—worth something. The guards' time—worth something. The very fact that we're imprisoned—worth something to Draven."

Cassian felt understanding bloom slowly. "I can't make big trades from here. But I can make small ones."

"Very small ones," Torin agreed. "Precise ones. The kind that look like nothing but change everything."

Mira leaned forward. "What are you two talking about?"

"The Law of Balance doesn't require possession," Cassian said slowly, his fragmented thoughts suddenly crystallizing. "It requires connection. I'm still bonded to the coins, which means I can still negotiate. Just... smaller. More carefully."

He closed his eyes again, reaching for the distant pulse of the Coin of Heads. This time he didn't try to use its power. He just asked a question.

*What is the value of this iron bar?*

The answer came back, faint but clear: *Two silver coins in raw material. Three silver for forged work. But currently holding four prisoners—value to Draven approximately twenty gold coins each, total eighty gold.*

*And what if the value of imprisonment decreased?*

The Law considered. *The value of imprisonment is measured by security. Reduce security, reduce value.*

Cassian opened his eyes. "The hinges. On these cell doors. They're old iron, poorly maintained. If I could trade away a tiny fraction of their structural integrity—make them just slightly weaker—"

"They'd still hold," Mira finished. "But one good kick might break them."

"Except I can't kick hard enough from this condition." Cassian gestured to his battered body. "Not without help."

All eyes turned to Perin. The carpenter sat slumped in his cell, but his shoulders were still broad. His arms still carried the strength of years hauling timber and swinging hammers.

"You want me to kick down the door?" Perin asked incredulously.

"After I weaken the hinges, yes."

"And then what? We fight our way through dozens of guards?"

"No." Cassian's mind was working faster now, pieces falling into place. "We create a distraction. Make them think we're trying to escape through the front entrance. While they're focused there, we slip up to the north wing, I grab the coins, and we leave through a window."

"That's the plan? That's your brilliant escape strategy?"

"It's insane," Mira agreed.

"It's also our only option," Torin said flatly. "Morning comes in five hours. Veylin returns. Interrogation escalates. Within two days, they'll have extracted everything useful and we'll either be killed or converted." His damaged expression somehow managed to convey certainty. "We try this now or we don't try at all."

Perin was quiet for a long moment. Then he stood, moving to his cell door. "Fine. Let's be insane together. Better than sitting here waiting to die."

Cassian felt a surge of gratitude. "Thank you."

"Thank me when we're not captured anymore." Perin tested the door, pushing experimentally. "These hinges. How weak can you make them?"

"Not very. Maybe twenty percent structural loss without making it obvious." Cassian reached for the Coin of Heads again, focusing on the hinges of Perin's cell door. "But twenty percent might be enough."

He entered the gray space—barely, just enough to perceive the value threads. The hinges were old iron, worth perhaps four copper coins for the pair. Their integrity held the door secure. Their value to Draven was the continued imprisonment of Perin.

Cassian spoke carefully to the Law: "I offer this trade. I'll pay with my own vitality—one week of my natural lifespan. In exchange, reduce the structural integrity of these hinges by exactly twenty percent. A fair trade for a small change."

The Law considered. It was a tiny trade, almost beneath notice. A week of life for weakened metal. The exchange wasn't even particularly efficient—Cassian was overpaying slightly.

Which was exactly why the Law accepted.

Value flowed out of Cassian—a week of his life, measured in heartbeats and breaths and potential moments. The hinges didn't visibly change, but their internal structure degraded. Microscopic cracks spread through the metal. The welds holding them to the door frame became brittle.

It cost Cassian more than it should have. Making trades remotely, with the coins so distant, was inefficient. He felt the week of life leaving him as something more like two weeks. The fragmentation from holding the tethers made every transaction harder.

But it worked.

"Now," Cassian said. "Put your shoulder against the door and push hard. Test if it gives."

Perin pressed his weight against the cell door. It held firm. "Nothing."

"Good. That means it's not obviously damaged." Cassian took a breath. "Now kick it. Hard as you can. Aim for where the hinges connect to the frame."

Perin stepped back, measured the distance, and drove his boot into the door with all his carpenter's strength.

The top hinge shattered.

The sound was deafening in the quiet cell block—metal shrieking, stone cracking. The door sagged inward, held only by the bottom hinge and the lock.

"Again!" Cassian shouted. "Before the guards—"

Footsteps thundered in the hallway. Guards rushing toward the noise.

Perin kicked again, desperation lending him strength. The bottom hinge snapped. The door crashed inward, still attached by the lock but torn completely off its hinges.

Perin squeezed through the gap, chains still binding his wrists.

Two guards rounded the corner, clubs raised.

Perin caught the first one with a headbutt—no finesse, just desperate violence. The guard went down. The second guard swung his club, catching Perin across the back. Perin grunted but kept moving, driving forward, tackling the guard into the wall.

"The keys!" Mira shouted. "Perin, the keys on his belt!"

Perin fumbled with his manacled hands, finally yanking the key ring free. He tossed it to Mira's cell. She caught it, fingers working frantically at the lock.

More guards coming. Boots on stone. Shouts echoing.

Mira got her door open and rushed to Cassian's cell, unlocking it with shaking hands. "Can you walk?"

"I'll have to." Cassian stumbled out, using the bars for support. His body screamed protest. "Torin! Come on!"

But Torin stood frozen in his cell, staring at the open door with blank confusion. The violence, the chaos, the sudden shift from imprisoned to free—it was too much. His damaged mind couldn't process the change fast enough.

"Torin!" Cassian grabbed the keys from Mira and unlocked the last cell. He moved to Torin, gripping his shoulders. "I need you here. Right now. With me. Can you do that?"

Torin's eyes focused slowly. "Here. Right now. With you." The words were mechanical, but he nodded. "Yes."

"Then move!"

They ran—stumbling, chains still dangling from their wrists, bodies battered—into the hallway as more guards poured in from both directions.

"East staircase!" Torin shouted, his cataloging mind providing navigation despite his emotional flatness. "Thirty feet ahead, then up!"

They made it to the stairs with guards closing in from behind. Perin, bringing up the rear, grabbed a wooden chair and threw it into the hallway. Guards crashed over it, buying precious seconds.

Up the stairs. Cassian's legs burned. His vision blurred. Every step was agony.

Second floor. A hallway lined with doors. 

"North wing," Cassian gasped. "Which way?"

"Left!" Torin pointed. "Last door at the end!"

They ran, leaving a trail of blood from various injuries. Behind them, guards filled the stairwell, shouting orders.

The door at the end of the hall was locked.

Perin threw himself against it—once, twice. On the third impact, the wood splintered. They crashed through into the laboratory.

Lanterns blazed. Tables full of instruments. And there, on black velvet—

Both coins.

Cassian lunged for them, hands outstretched.

The moment his fingers touched the Coin of Heads, power flooded back like a dam breaking. The bond snapped taut, fully reconnected, and suddenly he was complete again. The gray space opened around him in full clarity. Value threads blazed throughout the room.

He grabbed the Coin of Seeds with his other hand, and growth energy surged through his battered body. Not healing—he didn't have time for that—but potential. The promise that healing could happen. That growth could resume.

"Finally," he breathed.

Guards crashed through the door behind them.

Cassian turned, both coins burning in his palms. He entered the gray space fully, seeing the guards as bundles of value—their strength, their will, their wages, their duty.

"I offer this trade," he said clearly, speaking to the Law. "I'll take their wages for the next month. All six of them. In exchange, they let us leave peacefully."

The Law considered. It was a fair trade—thirty days of wages equaled roughly the value of letting four prisoners escape. The guards were being paid to stop them. If Cassian paid them more to allow them to leave...

The Law accepted.

All six guards suddenly felt understanding bloom in their minds. They were being paid more to step aside than to fight. The contract with their employer was fulfilled—they'd attempted to stop the escape. But now a better offer had emerged.

Economics, not loyalty.

Five of the six lowered their weapons and stepped aside.

The sixth—a woman with fierce eyes and a scar across her chin—shook her head. "I'm not paid to have honor, but I have it anyway. You're not leaving."

Cassian felt a flash of respect. "Then I'm sorry."

He reached into the gray space and pulled on the value of her consciousness—not to hollow her, but to gently suggest sleep. It cost him considerably more than the wage trade, draining vitality he couldn't spare, but it worked. The woman's eyes rolled back and she crumpled, unconscious but unharmed.

"Window!" Mira pointed to the far wall. "Now!"

They ran to it. Cassian looked down. Twenty feet to the alley below. Garbage bins. Cobblestones. A potentially fatal drop.

"I can cushion it," he said quickly, holding up the Coin of Seeds. "Make the landing softer. But we all have to jump together—I can't maintain it for multiple—"

"Just do it!" Perin shouted.

Cassian shattered the window with a chair, clearing the glass. He focused on the ground below, trading a piece of his own resilience to temporarily grant the cobblestones the softness of packed earth. It wasn't much—they'd still be bruised—but it beat broken bones.

"Jump!"

They jumped.

The fall was terrifying—a moment of weightlessness, wind roaring, impact approaching. Then they hit the softened ground with jarring force that knocked the breath from their lungs but didn't break anything vital.

Cassian rolled, agony shooting through his already battered body. The coins burned in his grip, still connected, still his.

"Move!" Mira dragged him upright. "They'll be right behind us!"

They ran into the maze of alleys, leaving the Merchant's Relief Society facility behind. Cassian could hear shouting. Boots on cobblestones. But they had a head start.

"Where do we go?" Perin gasped as they rounded a corner.

"Anywhere but here," Cassian managed. "Split up. Meet at—" He tried to think of a safe place, but his mind was still fragmented. "Meet at the old mill outside the eastern gate. Tomorrow night."

"That's your plan?" Mira demanded. "Split up and hope we all survive?"

"You have a better one?"

She didn't.

They reached an intersection and scattered—Mira disappearing south, Perin east, Torin west. Cassian stumbled north, clutching both coins, feeling them pulse with heat against his chest.

He'd reclaimed his power. They'd escaped the cell. But Draven was still out there, stronger than ever, and now he knew exactly how the coins' bond worked.

And somewhere in this city, the Coin of Oxen waited—the final piece Cassian needed but couldn't reach.

Behind him, more shouts. More boots. The hunt was on.

Cassian ran, vanishing into the shadows, and tried not to think about how little they'd actually gained, or how much they'd just lost.

---

In the wreckage of his laboratory, Draven Kane examined the shattered window and smiled.

"Let him run," he said calmly to the guards who awaited orders. "Let them all scatter like rats."

"Sir? We should pursue—"

"No need." Draven touched the golden locket at his throat, feeling the Coin of Oxen pulse within. "I learned what I needed. The bond can't be severed remotely. He can use the coins from a distance, but weakly. And most importantly—he's predictable."

He turned to Administrator Veylin, who stood in the doorway with controlled fury on her face. "You were right about him. Self-sacrificing. Desperate to save his friends. Willing to trade away pieces of himself for the smallest gains."

"He escaped with both coins."

"I let him escape with both coins." Draven gestured to his notes on the desk—pages filled with observations about how the coins' bonds functioned. "This was worth far more than keeping him in a cell. Now I know his limitations. His costs. His patterns."

"And the Unhollow? Do we hunt them down?"

"Eventually. But not tonight." Draven moved to the window, looking out at the dark city. "Let them think they've won. Let them regroup and plan their next desperate move. Every time they act, they reveal more. Every rescue attempt costs them vitality they can't recover. Eventually, there won't be enough of Cassian left to save anyone."

"And the third coin?"

"Let him come for it. I'll be waiting." Draven's smile widened. "In fact, I think it's time to make this whole situation more... interesting."

He turned back to Veylin. "Send word to the King. Tell him we're willing to negotiate the release of certain prisoners we recaptured from tonight's escape. In exchange for... let's say, official recognition of the Merchant's Relief Society as a legitimate charitable organization. Protected under crown law."

"You're giving him a choice. Save the converts we recaptured, or maintain political neutrality."

"Exactly. Either way, we win. If he accepts, we get legal protection and he admits he can't stop us. If he refuses, those eight fully restored converts we recaptured get forcibly re-integrated, and the city learns their King won't lift a finger to save them."

Veylin nodded slowly. "And Cassian?"

"Cassian will try to rescue them himself. He won't be able to help it." Draven returned to his desk, already planning. "And when he does, I'll be ready. With the Coin of Oxen. With proper preparation. With guards who understand what they're facing."

"You think he'll come even knowing it's a trap?"

"I know he will. Because that's who he is." Draven sat, pulling out fresh paper to begin writing. "He's a man who trades away pieces of himself to save strangers. Who sacrifices his own vitality for people who might not even survive. Who can't walk away from someone in need, even when walking away is the smart choice."

"That's not a strength. That's a weakness."

"That," Draven said softly, "is exactly what makes him so easy to destroy."

---

Cassian collapsed in an alley three blocks away, lungs burning, legs giving out. He clutched both coins to his chest, feeling them pulse in sync with his racing heart.

He'd escaped. They'd all escaped.

But eight people they'd freed were back in Draven's hands. The guards they'd bribed would face punishment. And Draven now knew exactly how the coins worked when used remotely.

*We gained nothing,* Cassian thought bitterly. *We're right back where we started, only weaker.*

The coins burned against his skin, still connected, still his.

But for how much longer?

And at what cost?
