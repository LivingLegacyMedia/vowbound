# Chapter 2: An Impossible Trade

Cassian couldn't focus.

The ledger lay open before him, columns of numbers that should have been his refuge—clean, logical, orderly. But every time he tried to read them, the shimmer intruded. The numbers themselves glowed with their own weight of meaning: the widow's tax payment heavy with sacrifice, the merchant guild's contribution tainted with corruption, the temple's tithe bright with genuine devotion.

It had been three days since he'd touched the medallion. Three days of seeing the world transformed into layers of invisible worth. Three days of wondering if he was going mad.

He pressed his palms against his eyes. The gesture didn't help. The shimmer existed behind his eyelids too, painting patterns in the darkness.

"Master Cassian?"

He looked up. The magistrate's clerk stood in the doorway of the counting house, a small wooden case in his hands and a carefully neutral expression on his face.

"The magistrate asked me to deliver this," the clerk said, setting the case on Cassian's desk. "He said you'd understand."

Cassian opened it. Inside, nestled in velvet, were the shattered remains of his surveying compass—the precision instrument he used to verify property measurements for tax assessments. Someone had taken a hammer to it. The brass housing was dented, the glass face cracked, the delicate needle bent beyond repair.

The clerk was already leaving. "Oh, and the magistrate mentioned you'll need a proper one for next week's survey of the Westridge properties. He's expecting accurate measurements." The door closed softly behind him.

Cassian stared at the ruins of his compass. A replacement would cost at least three months' salary. Money he didn't have. Money the magistrate knew he didn't have.

*Petty revenge,* he thought. *But effective.*

The shimmer around the broken compass was almost mocking—all that craftsmanship and value, reduced to scrap. He could *feel* what it had been worth, what it could never be again.

He needed a replacement. And there was only one merchant in Millhaven who dealt in precision instruments.

Merchant Varon.

---

Varon's establishment occupied a prime corner of the market square, a three-story building of stone and timber that spoke of old money and older reputation. The ground floor was his shop, the upper levels his residence. A painted sign above the door read: *VARON & SONS - FINE GOODS & INSTRUMENTS - EST. 187*

There had never been any sons.

Cassian stood across the square, watching customers come and go. He saw the shimmer around each transaction—the exchanges of coin for goods, desire for satisfaction. But every trade that passed through Varon's hands seemed to leave the merchant with slightly more value than he'd given. Not cheating, exactly. Just... advantage. Always advantage.

Varon was legendary. No one negotiated with him successfully. He had a gift for finding what people wanted and making them pay more than they intended. Some said he could smell desperation. Others said he simply understood human nature better than humans did.

Cassian reached into his pocket and felt the outline of the medallion. He'd brought it with him, wrapped carefully in cloth. He hadn't dared leave it at home—the thought of being separated from it created a physical ache in his chest.

But he also carried something else. A small paper envelope, holding a single seed.

It came from his father's collection—the sparse belongings Cassian was still sorting through. Rowan had kept a small wooden case of seeds, each one carefully labeled in his spidery handwriting. This one was marked: *Wild Thornheart. Four generations. Plant in spring, harvest in summer. Mother's favorite.*

Cassian had almost thrown them all away. Just seeds, after all. What use were they?

But the shimmer had shown him otherwise. When he'd held this particular seed, the weight of meaning had been staggering. Generations. Continuity. Life persisting through time, connecting the living to the dead.

He didn't know if it would be enough.

Taking a breath, Cassian crossed the square and entered Varon's shop.

The interior was dimly lit, crowded with shelves displaying an eclectic array of goods: scientific instruments, rare books, clockwork devices, musical instruments, navigational equipment. Everything gleamed with careful maintenance. Everything was precisely priced. The shimmer here was almost overwhelming—a warehouse of accumulated value.

Behind the counter stood Merchant Varon himself.

He was older than Cassian had expected. Seventy, perhaps, though he carried himself with rigid dignity. His clothes were expensive but practical, his hair white and precisely trimmed, his hands steady as he examined a pocket watch through a jeweler's loupe.

"Master Cassian," Varon said without looking up. "The ledger-keeper who corrected the magistrate's arithmetic. You've been standing outside my shop for seven minutes. If you're gathering courage, you're wasting both our time. If you're planning theft, I should warn you my locks are excellent."

Cassian approached the counter. "I need a surveying compass. The magistrate's clerk... damaged mine."

"I heard." Varon set down the watch and the loupe, finally meeting Cassian's gaze. "I also heard you cost yourself a quarter's bonus to expose tax fraud. Admirable, but impractical. And now you need an expensive instrument you can't afford. The world rewards stupidity with efficiency, doesn't it?"

"I can pay."

"Can you?" Varon's smile was thin. "I have one suitable compass in stock. Forty gold royals. I don't offer credit to ledger-keepers who make magistrates angry."

Forty royals. Cassian had twelve in savings, and that had to last him until his next payment.

He set the paper envelope on the counter.

Varon didn't touch it. "What is this?"

"A trade."

"I don't trade in paper and hope, boy."

"It's a seed." Cassian kept his voice steady. "A rare heirloom variety called Wild Thornheart. It's been in my family for four generations. My father's mother brought it from the Old Provinces. My mother grew it in our garden. My father saved one seed from every harvest."

Varon's expression didn't change. "A seed for a precision instrument? You're as mad as your father."

The words stung, but Cassian had expected them. He pressed on. "This isn't an ordinary seed. It produces a flowering vine with—"

"I know what Wild Thornheart is," Varon interrupted. "I'm seventy-three years old, Master Cassian. I've been a merchant since before you were born. I know the value of rare seeds. And I know that forty gold royals can buy me a dozen such seeds from any botanist in the capital."

"Not like this one."

"No?" Varon's tone was sharp with challenge. "Explain."

This was the moment. Cassian reached into his mind, toward that strange new sense the medallion had awakened. He let his awareness extend toward Varon, searching for the shimmer that would tell him what the merchant truly valued.

The response wasn't what he expected.

No clear answer. No voice whispering *he wants this* or *offer him that.*

Instead, images flooded Cassian's mind. Abstract. Fragmentary. Emotional.

*Empty rooms. Large rooms, well-furnished, but silent. No voices. No laughter.*

*A woman's face, young and hopeful. Dark hair, merchant's clothes. She's holding flowers—deep purple blooms with silver-edged petals that seem to glow in the sunlight. Wild Thornheart. She's offering them to someone. To Varon. "Plant one with me," she's saying. "Let's grow something together."*

*But he's shaking his head. "After I've established myself. After the next trade route. After—"*

*The same woman, older now. Hair graying at the temples. Standing in a garden absolutely covered in Wild Thornheart vines, their blooms cascading over trellises. She's no longer looking toward Varon's shop. She's turned away.*

*A wedding. The woman in white, wearing a crown of purple and silver flowers. Wild Thornheart woven through her hair, clutched in her bouquet. Marrying a baker with flour on his hands and love in his eyes. The flowers are everywhere—the church entrance, the altar, the guests' lapels.*

*Varon standing at the back of the crowd, watching. Alone. His hands empty while everyone else holds blooms she's given them.*

*And beneath it all, a realization: she'd kept growing them. For years. Hoping he'd come. Until finally she'd stopped hoping and gave her heart to someone else.*

Cassian blinked, the visions receding. His chest felt tight. He understood now—not just Varon's loneliness, but its specific shape. The woman who'd offered to build something with him. The flowers she'd grown, year after year, that had bloomed at her wedding to another man.

Varon was watching him with narrowed eyes. "You're wasting my time."

Cassian's mouth was dry. He had to be right about this. "The Wild Thornheart isn't just rare because it takes four generations to cultivate. It's rare because only a handful of people in the region know how to grow it anymore." He met Varon's gaze. "Meredith Baker was one of them, wasn't she?"

Varon's face went absolutely still.

"She grew them in her garden," Cassian continued, his heart pounding. "For decades. She was known for it. People came from three towns over to buy her blooms." He paused. "You could have bought from her. Any time these last thirty years. But you never did."

The silence stretched impossibly long.

"No," Varon said finally, his voice barely above a whisper. "I never did."

Because his pride wouldn't allow it, Cassian thought to himself. Because going to her, even as a customer, would have meant admitting he'd been wrong. Would have meant seeing the life she'd built without him, the garden she'd planted with someone else.

"This seed came from her original strain," Cassian said quietly. "Meredith's mother and my great-grandmother were friends in the Old Provinces. When they both moved here to start new lives, they shared cuttings and seeds—including the Wild Thornheart. My family's been growing it for four generations from that original stock. It's the same variety Meredith grew. The same flowers she wore when—" He stopped, not needing to finish.

Varon's jaw worked silently.

"This seed," Cassian said carefully, "has grown in my family's garden for four generations. The same flowers Meredith grew. The ones she wore in her hair." He paused. "She died two years ago. Her children sold the bakery and moved to Corwell. The garden was torn up for new construction. As far as I know, this is one of the last seeds of her original strain left in Millhaven."

Varon's expression was unreadable, but Cassian could see the pulse hammering in his throat.

"You could search the botanists in the capital," Cassian continued quietly. "Spend your forty gold royals. But you'd never know for certain if what you bought came from her garden. From the flowers she offered you when you were young." He met the old man's eyes. "This did. And after I'm gone, no one else will have one."

"You think I want a garden?" Varon's voice was strained, barely controlled.

"I think you want one last chance to plant something she asked you to plant fifty years ago," Cassian said. "I think you want to walk past a trellis covered in purple and silver blooms and remember that once, someone loved you enough to wait. And you want to tend it with your own hands, the way you should have done with her."

The merchant's jaw tightened almost imperceptibly.

"But I also think you'll never go to her grave," Cassian added softly. "Never admit you were wrong. Never humble yourself enough to ask her children for a seed from the garden that no longer exists." He set the envelope more firmly on the counter. "So this is your chance. The only Wild Thornheart you'll ever know for sure that came from her hands to mine."

Silence.

Varon stared at the envelope for a long moment. Then, slowly, his hand trembling, he reached for it.

His hands were shaking.

He opened it carefully, tipping the single seed into his palm. It was small, dark, unremarkable to anyone who didn't know what it could become. But as he looked at it, Cassian saw the old merchant's carefully maintained control begin to crack.

"Your father," Varon said, his voice rough, "tried to give me one of these. Fifty years ago." His fingers closed around the seed. "He said: 'Varon, it's not too late. She'd still wait for you if you'd plant this with her.' I called him a sentimental fool."

Cassian's throat tightened. His father had known. Had tried to help.

"I told him I had trade routes to establish. Contracts to finalize. That gardens were for people with time to waste." Varon's voice cracked. "He said I was trading away my life for things that would turn to dust. He was right."

The silence stretched between them.

He set the seed down gently on the counter, then turned and retrieved a wooden case from the shelf behind him. Inside was the surveying compass—brass and glass, precision-made, worth every bit of forty royals.

"I accept the trade," he said quietly.

As the compass and the seed changed hands, Cassian felt something shift in the air. The shimmer around both objects pulsed, equalized, and settled. Not in price—they would never be equal in price. But in *meaning*, in *worth*, they balanced perfectly.

The compass represented Cassian's livelihood, his ability to do his job. The seed represented Varon's last chance to grow something he should have planted a long time ago. Both were necessary. Both were precious. Both had value beyond what money could measure.

Cassian's pulse quickened. It had worked. He'd read the abstract impressions correctly, interpreted what Varon truly valued beneath all his defenses. This wasn't just the medallion showing him truth—this was *his* ability to understand it, to translate cryptic visions into human meaning.

Varon carefully placed the seed in a small wooden box lined with soft cloth, handling it with a gentleness that seemed at odds with his reputation. For a long moment, he just stared at it, his jaw working as if he were fighting back words he'd kept locked away for decades.

"Your father understood something most people never do," he said finally, his voice carefully controlled again. "That value exists beyond what we can count or own. That some trades cost us everything even when we think we're winning." He looked up at Cassian. "I've spent seventy-three years getting the better end of every negotiation. But I lost the only deal that mattered."

He closed the wooden box with a soft click. "Come back in spring. I'll show you where I plant it." A pause, and his eyes held Cassian's for a moment. "And perhaps... perhaps you can tell me more about your father. What he was searching for in all those expeditions. I think I owe him the courtesy of listening this time."

Cassian nodded, his throat too tight to speak. He thought of the woman in the vision—the one who'd grown flowers and waited, then stopped waiting and built a good life with someone who knew what mattered.

"She had a good life," Cassian said softly, the impressions still echoing in his mind. "The baker loved her. Six children. Many grandchildren. Her garden was famous for three counties. She was happy."

Varon's hand froze on the wooden box. His eyes widened slightly, searching Cassian's face. "How did you—" He stopped, understanding flickering across his features. His father's son indeed.

"Yes," Varon said quietly, his voice breaking on the word. "I heard that. Years ago. Someone told me at the market." He swallowed hard. "I'm... I'm glad she was happy. She deserved that. She deserved better than what I could give her."

The words were simple, but the cost of saying them was written in every line of his face.

Cassian nodded once more and turned to leave, giving the old merchant privacy for whatever grief or relief he needed to feel.

As he left Varon's shop, the weight of the compass in his hands felt different. Not just a tool, but proof that his father had been right about something fundamental. That value existed beyond price. That some trades mattered more than others.

And that maybe, just maybe, Cassian could learn to see what his father had seen.

---

Over the next several days, Cassian experimented cautiously.

He didn't announce his ability. Didn't advertise. He simply... watched. Observed. Tested quietly.

In the marketplace, he would stand at the edges and study the shimmer that danced in front of his eyes. A farmer selling grain to a baker. A woman buying cloth from a weaver. He focused on his sixth sense, trying to understand what each person truly valued in the exchange.

Sometimes it was simple: gold for goods.

But other times, things went a few layers deeper. A mother buying bread sought relief from her children's hunger. In his mind's eye, Cassian saw an image of small hands reaching out, small mouths opening, and being filled. A man buying wine wanted to forget everything—and Cassian visualized this through impressions of shadows closing in...the drowning of memories.

The medallion brought it all to the surface.

Cassian tried small interventions. Private ones.

The baker's assistant had lingered near the shop for days, clearly wanting to speak to his employer, but hesitating. Cassian watched, reading the impressions: duty versus fear. The assistant wanted time away—family emergency, perhaps? But feared asking.

Cassian approached the baker privately. "Your assistant needs three days leave. His mother is sick in the next town."

The baker frowned. "He didn't tell me."

"He's afraid to ask. But I can manage your accounts for three days. No charge. Call it... an investment in community relations."

The baker agreed. The assistant left, grateful but confused. "How did you know?" he'd asked.

Cassian had no good answer.

He tried again with the cooper, old Breven. The man's accounts were in shambles—not through incompetence, but through stress. Cassian saw the impressions: weights pressing down, sleepless nights, a secret gnawing at his chest. After careful observation, he realized: Breven had overcharged the temple for repairs months ago. The error haunted him.

Cassian arranged a quiet meeting. "The temple's books show a discrepancy in your favor. I can help you return the excess and frame it as a voluntary correction. The priest values honesty. He'll respect the gesture."

Breven stared. "How did you..."

"I notice patterns," Cassian said simply.

The correction was made. Breven's relief was palpable. But the look he gave Cassian afterward wasn't just gratitude—it was wariness. *How much does this man see?*

Each small success taught Cassian something. The medallion showed truth, but interpreting it was an art. Sometimes the impressions were clear: flowing sand for time, interlocking hands for trust. Other times they were maddeningly abstract: spiraling circles, distant echoes, colors he couldn't name.

He was learning. But slowly. Carefully.

---

The real test came six days after his trade with Varon.

Cassian was crossing the market square when he heard raised voices near the fountain. A crowd had gathered—always a sign of either entertainment or trouble. He approached cautiously.

Two merchants stood facing each other, both red-faced with anger. One was Helena, the weaver—a woman in her forties with calloused hands and a reputation for quality work. The other was Master Orin, who ran the dye shop three streets over. Between them, on the cobblestones, lay a bolt of ruined cloth.

"You sold me defective dye!" Helena's voice shook with fury. "Look at it! Three days' work completely destroyed!"

"My dyes are perfectly good," Orin shot back. "You must have used the wrong water ratio. This is your error, not mine."

"I've been weaving for twenty-five years! I know how to mix dye!"

"Then perhaps your water source is contaminated. Perhaps your vat is dirty. Perhaps—"

"Perhaps you cut your indigo with ash to stretch your supply!"

The crowd murmured. That was a serious accusation—selling adulterated goods was grounds for losing one's merchant license.

Orin's face went purple. "How dare you—"

"Please," Cassian said, stepping forward. "May I look at the cloth?"

Both merchants turned to stare at him. Helena's eyes narrowed. "This isn't your concern, ledger-keeper."

"No, but I might be able to help." He kept his voice calm, non-threatening. "I've been studying marketplace transactions. Sometimes disputes arise from misunderstandings rather than malice."

"There's no misunderstanding," Helena said bitterly. "My cloth is ruined, and I've lost a week's wages."

Cassian crouched down and touched the ruined fabric. The shimmer appeared immediately—and with it, a flood of impressions.

*Helena's hands, moving through the familiar motions of her craft. Pride in the work. Then confusion as the color began to run, to streak, to destroy hours of careful weaving. Panic. Anger covering fear—fear that her reputation would be damaged, that customers would blame her, that she'd lose the commission that was supposed to pay for her daughter's medicine.*

He shifted his focus to Orin, letting the medallion read the dye merchant.

*Orin in his shop, carefully mixing compounds. His hands were steady, his measurements precise. Pride in his craft, too. But beneath it—worry. The indigo shipment had been late this season. Prices were rising. He'd had to make choices: raise prices and lose customers, or find ways to make his supply stretch further. But not cutting it with ash. Never that. He'd added a binding agent instead, something that should have been harmless. Should have been.*

*But what if the binding agent reacted badly with certain water sources? What if it was incompatible with Helena's well water, or her vat's iron content? A mistake born of ignorance, not malice.*

Cassian stood, his mind racing to connect the pieces.

"Master Orin," he said carefully, "did you change your formula recently? Add anything new to help the dye set?"

Orin's defensive posture faltered slightly. "I... I added gum arabic. To help it bind. It's a common additive—"

"And Helena, you recently started drawing water from the new well the town dug last month, didn't you?"

She blinked. "How did you know?"

"I keep track of municipal changes. That well has a higher mineral content than the old one—the engineers mentioned it in their report." He looked between them. "Gum arabic reacts badly with iron-rich water. It causes dye to streak and run. Neither of you did anything wrong. You just didn't know the two elements would conflict."

Silence fell over the crowd.

Orin's anger drained away, replaced by dismay. "I... I didn't know. I've never used gum arabic with that water source. I was trying to help the dye last longer—"

"And you succeeded," Cassian said. "It just requires different water. Helena, if you use distilled water or water from the old well for your next batch, Orin's dye will work perfectly."

Helena stared at the ruined cloth, then at Orin. Her anger was fading, but the financial damage remained. "That doesn't replace my lost week."

Cassian turned to Orin. "You're not at fault, but you could have warned customers about the water compatibility issue. A week of Helena's labor is worth, what—five silver crowns?"

"About that," Helena admitted grudgingly.

Cassian focused on Orin again, reading the impressions. *Guilt mixing with relief. He hadn't known, but he should have tested more thoroughly. And beneath it—the desire to protect his reputation. If word spread that his dyes were "incompatible," customers would blame him regardless of the technical truth.*

"Master Orin," Cassian said, "if you provide Helena with replacement dye and compensate her for the lost time, she'll tell her customers that the error was in the water, not your product. Your reputation stays intact, and she's made whole."

Orin hesitated, calculating. "That would cost me... ten silver crowns, counting the dye and the compensation."

"But it protects your business," Cassian countered. "And Helena's testimony that your dyes are good—just water-sensitive—actually demonstrates quality control. You're not selling cheap product. You're selling specialized product that requires proper handling."

He could see the moment Orin's mind shifted, seeing the path forward.

"Done," Orin said gruffly. He extended his hand to Helena. "I apologize for the confusion. I should have been more thorough in my testing."

Helena took his hand slowly. "And I apologize for accusing you of cutting your supply. I know you're an honest merchant."

The crowd, sensing the drama was over, began to disperse. Cassian started to step back, his work done, but Helena caught his arm.

"How did you know about the water?" she asked quietly. "And about the compensation before either of us suggested it?"

Cassian's mouth went dry. He'd been too specific, revealed too much. "I told you. I study patterns."

Helena didn't look convinced, but she nodded slowly. "Perhaps." She released his arm. "Thank you, Master Cassian. For whatever you did. However you did it."

She and Orin walked away together, already discussing the details of the compensation. Cassian stood alone by the fountain, his heart still racing.

He'd helped them. Truly helped them. Found a solution that left both parties whole. But he'd also revealed more than he should have. Helena was suspicious now. And if she talked to others, compared notes...

Cassian needed to be more careful. The medallion was a gift, but it could also draw unwanted attention.

---

Over the following days, Cassian threw himself into understanding his new ability.

He documented everything in a leather-bound journal he'd purchased specifically for this purpose. Every impression, every correlation, every pattern he observed. The medallion showed him raw data—abstract imagery, emotional resonances—and his mind worked to translate it into systematic understanding.

Time appeared as flowing sand or lengthening shadows. Trust as interlocking hands or foundations of stone. Grief as empty vessels, hope as rising light, pain as broken glass. Each emotion, each value, had its own symbolic language that he was learning to read.

He filled page after page with observations and theories. The more he documented, the more patterns emerged. He wasn't just learning individual trades anymore. He was beginning to see the entire invisible economy that governed human interaction. Every relationship was a ledger of debts and credits. Every emotion had a value that could be quantified, transferred, traded.

It was elegant. Beautiful. Consuming.

---

Ten days after his trade with Varon, Cassian was working late in the counting house when he noticed something odd.

He'd been reviewing the marketplace dispute records—minor conflicts between merchants that the magistrate's office typically arbitrated. Most were simple: disagreements over prices, accusations of short-weighting, arguments about stall positions.

But as he read through them, patterns emerged.

The baker's wife had fallen ill two years ago. The records showed she'd consulted a traveling healer who'd taken payment in the form of "future consideration"—terms left deliberately vague.

Old Breven's financial troubles had started after he'd accepted a generous loan from a well-dressed stranger who'd asked for no collateral, no interest, just "a small favor when the time comes."

The cooper's apprentice had left town abruptly, and his father had mentioned the boy had met someone who "offered him opportunities beyond his station."

Small threads. Disconnected events.

But Cassian's new awareness saw something others had missed: a pattern of asymmetric exchanges. Trades that looked generous on the surface but created undefined future obligations. Value given freely in the present, with costs deferred to an uncertain later.

Cassian set down his pen, unease prickling at the back of his neck. These weren't random acts of charity. These were calculated investments. Someone was making trades with the townsfolk, and the terms were deliberately obscure.

He needed to see one of these people directly. Talk to them. Use the medallion to understand what was really happening.

---

The baker's wife lived in Southgate district, not far from where widow Marta had her small room. Cassian found the house as evening was settling over Millhaven, the sky bruising purple with approaching night.

He knocked, and the woman who answered made his blood run cold.

It was her—he recognized her face from the market, where she'd always been quick with a smile and warm greetings. But something fundamental had changed.

Her eyes were flat. Not sad, not tired—*flat*. Like someone had drained the light from behind them.

"Master Cassian." Her voice was perfectly polite, perfectly neutral. No warmth, no curiosity, just... empty courtesy.

"I wanted to check on you," he said, trying to keep his voice steady. "I heard you'd consulted a healer a few years ago. I was wondering if—"

"The healer was very helpful." The words were correct, but delivered without inflection. "She took away my pain. I'm much better now."

Cassian focused on her, letting the medallion show him what lay beneath the surface.

The vision that flooded his mind made him stumble backward.

*Emptiness. Not darkness, not void, but absence. Where there should have been the shimmer of human value—fears, hopes, loves, regrets—there was just... nothing. A hollow space in the shape of a person.*

*And at the edges, barely visible, threads of gold leading away. Connections that had been severed, value that had been extracted, like roots torn from soil.*

"Are you well, Master Cassian?" she asked, and even her concern was hollow. The words of someone who remembered how to fake caring but no longer felt it.

"I'm fine," he managed. "Thank you."

He turned and walked away quickly, his heart hammering. Behind him, the door closed with a soft click.

Three streets over, he stopped in an alley and leaned against the wall, breathing hard. The baker's wife. She'd been kind once, he was certain of it. He'd seen her in the market, heard her laugh with other merchants, watched her dote on her children.

Now she was a shell. Something wearing a human face, going through the motions, but fundamentally *gone*.

His father's letter echoed in his mind: *Refugees fleeing something that empties people from the inside. Towns where people traded away their suffering and became empty husks.*

It was here. In Millhaven. Not coming—already *here*.

And he'd been so focused on learning his new power, so consumed with small interventions and documenting his observations, that he'd missed the real danger spreading through his own town.

Cassian pulled out his journal with shaking hands and began to write urgently in the dying light:

*Pattern confirmed. The generous trades aren't charity—they're extractions. Someone is taking value from people, leaving them empty. The baker's wife consulted a "healer" who "took away her pain." But she took more than pain. She took everything that made her human.*

*Question: Who is making these trades? The well-dressed stranger offering loans? The traveling healer? Are they the same person? Different agents working together?*

*Question: Can this be reversed? If value has been taken, can it be restored?*

*Question: How do I stop this without understanding the rules they're playing by?*

He closed the journal, his mind racing. This was bigger than tax fraud, bigger than broken compasses and marketplace disputes. People were being *consumed* from the inside out, and he was possibly the only person in Millhaven who could see it happening.

The medallion burned warm against his chest, as if responding to his determination.

His father had believed this artifact could stop the Hollow—or at least understand it. Cassian didn't know if that was true. Didn't know if he was capable of facing something that could hollow out human souls.

But he knew he had to try.

Because if he didn't, Millhaven would become another empty town full of empty people, and everything he'd tried to protect—the widow Marta, old Breven, Helena and her daughter—would be lost to whatever darkness was making these impossible trades.

The autumn wind picked up, carrying the scent of smoke and coming rain. Somewhere in the distance, more refugees would be arriving tonight, fleeing towns that had already fallen.

Cassian tucked his journal into his coat and started walking back toward his rooms. He had work to do. Patterns to trace. A threat to understand.

And somewhere in in the distance, someone was making bargains that sounded too good to be true.

He needed to find them before they made ruins of Millhaven.
