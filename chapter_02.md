# Chapter 2: An Impossible Trade

Cassian couldn't focus.

The ledger lay open before him, columns of numbers that should have been his refuge—clean, logical, orderly. But every time he tried to read them, the shimmer intruded. The numbers themselves glowed with their own weight of meaning: the widow's tax payment heavy with sacrifice, the merchant guild's contribution tainted with corruption, the temple's tithe bright with genuine devotion.

It had been three days since he'd touched the medallion. Three days of seeing the world transformed into layers of invisible worth. Three days of wondering if he was going mad.

He pressed his palms against his eyes. The gesture didn't help. The shimmer existed behind his eyelids too, painting patterns in the darkness.

"Master Cassian?"

He looked up. The magistrate's clerk stood in the doorway of the counting house, a small wooden case in his hands and a carefully neutral expression on his face.

"The magistrate asked me to deliver this," the clerk said, setting the case on Cassian's desk. "He said you'd understand."

Cassian opened it. Inside, nestled in velvet, were the shattered remains of his surveying compass—the precision instrument he used to verify property measurements for tax assessments. Someone had taken a hammer to it. The brass housing was dented, the glass face cracked, the delicate needle bent beyond repair.

The clerk was already leaving. "Oh, and the magistrate mentioned you'll need a proper one for next week's survey of the Westridge properties. He's expecting accurate measurements." The door closed softly behind him.

Cassian stared at the ruins of his compass. A replacement would cost at least three months' salary. Money he didn't have. Money the magistrate knew he didn't have.

*Petty revenge,* he thought. *But effective.*

The shimmer around the broken compass was almost mocking—all that craftsmanship and value, reduced to scrap. He could *feel* what it had been worth, what it could never be again.

He needed a replacement. And there was only one merchant in Millhaven who dealt in precision instruments.

Merchant Varon.

---

Varon's establishment occupied a prime corner of the market square, a three-story building of stone and timber that spoke of old money and older reputation. The ground floor was his shop, the upper levels his residence. A painted sign above the door read: *VARON & SONS - FINE GOODS & INSTRUMENTS - EST. 187*

There had never been any sons.

Cassian stood across the square, watching customers come and go. He saw the shimmer around each transaction—the exchanges of coin for goods, desire for satisfaction. But every trade that passed through Varon's hands seemed to leave the merchant with slightly more value than he'd given. Not cheating, exactly. Just... advantage. Always advantage.

Varon was legendary. No one negotiated with him successfully. He had a gift for finding what people wanted and making them pay more than they intended. Some said he could smell desperation. Others said he simply understood human nature better than humans did.

Cassian reached into his pocket and felt the outline of the medallion. He'd brought it with him, wrapped carefully in cloth. He hadn't dared leave it at home—the thought of being separated from it created a physical ache in his chest.

But he also carried something else. A small paper envelope, holding a single seed.

It came from his father's collection—the sparse belongings Cassian was still sorting through. Rowan had kept a small wooden case of seeds, each one carefully labeled in his spidery handwriting. This one was marked: *Wild Thornheart. Four generations. Plant in spring, harvest in summer. Mother's favorite.*

Cassian had almost thrown them all away. Just seeds, after all. What use were they?

But the shimmer had shown him otherwise. When he'd held this particular seed, the weight of meaning had been staggering. Generations. Continuity. Life persisting through time, connecting the living to the dead.

He didn't know if it would be enough.

Taking a breath, Cassian crossed the square and entered Varon's shop.

The interior was dimly lit, crowded with shelves displaying an eclectic array of goods: scientific instruments, rare books, clockwork devices, musical instruments, navigational equipment. Everything gleamed with careful maintenance. Everything was precisely priced. The shimmer here was almost overwhelming—a warehouse of accumulated value.

Behind the counter stood Merchant Varon himself.

He was older than Cassian had expected. Seventy, perhaps, though he carried himself with rigid dignity. His clothes were expensive but practical, his hair white and precisely trimmed, his hands steady as he examined a pocket watch through a jeweler's loupe.

"Master Cassian," Varon said without looking up. "The ledger-keeper who corrected the magistrate's arithmetic. You've been standing outside my shop for seven minutes. If you're gathering courage, you're wasting both our time. If you're planning theft, I should warn you my locks are excellent."

Cassian approached the counter. "I need a surveying compass. The magistrate's clerk... damaged mine."

"I heard." Varon set down the watch and the loupe, finally meeting Cassian's gaze. "I also heard you cost yourself a quarter's bonus to expose tax fraud. Admirable, but impractical. And now you need an expensive instrument you can't afford. The world rewards stupidity with efficiency, doesn't it?"

"I can pay."

"Can you?" Varon's smile was thin. "I have one suitable compass in stock. Forty gold royals. I don't offer credit to ledger-keepers who make magistrates angry."

Forty royals. Cassian had twelve in savings, and that had to last him until his next payment.

He set the paper envelope on the counter.

Varon didn't touch it. "What is this?"

"A trade."

"I don't trade in paper and hope, boy."

"It's a seed." Cassian kept his voice steady. "A rare heirloom variety called Wild Thornheart. It's been in my family for four generations. My father's mother brought it from the Old Provinces. My mother grew it in our garden. My father saved one seed from every harvest."

Varon's expression didn't change. "A seed for a precision instrument? You're as mad as your father."

The words stung, but Cassian had expected them. He pressed on. "This isn't an ordinary seed. It produces a flowering vine with—"

"I know what Wild Thornheart is," Varon interrupted. "I'm seventy-three years old, Master Cassian. I've been a merchant since before you were born. I know the value of rare seeds. And I know that forty gold royals can buy me a dozen such seeds from any botanist in the capital."

"Not like this one."

"No?" Varon's tone was sharp with challenge. "Explain."

This was the moment. Cassian reached into his mind, toward that strange new sense the medallion had awakened. He let his awareness extend toward Varon, searching for the shimmer that would tell him what the merchant truly valued.

The response wasn't what he expected.

No clear answer. No voice whispering *he wants this* or *offer him that.*

Instead, images flooded Cassian's mind. Abstract. Fragmentary. Emotional.

*Empty rooms. Large rooms, well-furnished, but silent. No voices. No laughter.*

*Hands holding ledgers. Papers covered in numbers. Assets, properties, investments. Everything counted. Everything owned. Everything alone.*

*Fading memories. Faces that blur with time. Names that slip away. The terror of being forgotten.*

*A grave with no visitors. Wealth that passes to distant cousins who never knew him. A life measured in gold that turns to dust.*

Cassian blinked, the visions receding. His pulse was racing. What did it mean?

Varon was watching him with narrowed eyes. "You're wasting my time."

*Think,* Cassian told himself. *Interpret.*

Empty rooms. No family. Varon was a wealthy man, but he lived alone. The sign outside said *& SONS*, but there were no sons. No heirs. No one to carry his name forward.

Hands holding ledgers, counting wealth. He'd built an empire of things, but what did it mean if no one came after him?

Fading memories. Fear of being forgotten.

It clicked.

Varon wasn't driven by greed. He was driven by something deeper. Loneliness? No—not quite. It was more existential than that.

Legacy.

He had everything, and he had nothing. Wealth that would scatter to strangers when he died. No continuity. No connection to the future.

The seed wasn't just a seed. It was something that could outlive him. Something that would grow, generation after generation, connecting past to future. A living legacy.

But Cassian wasn't certain. The images had been abstract, open to interpretation. He could be completely wrong.

He had to guess.

"This seed," Cassian said carefully, "has grown in my family's garden for four generations. My great-grandmother planted the first one. My grandmother saved seeds from the harvest and planted them again. My mother did the same. My father did the same. And now it's passed to me."

Varon's expression was unreadable.

"But I have no garden," Cassian continued. "No house, really. Just a rented room above the counting house. This seed will die with me. Four generations of continuity, ended." He paused. "Unless someone who values legacy more than I do takes it. Plants it. Tends it. Passes it on."

"You think I want a garden?" Varon's voice was flat.

"I think you want something of yours to outlive your fortune." Cassian met his gaze. "You've built an empire of things. Rare goods, valuable instruments, gold in the vault. But when you're gone, it all scatters. Distant cousins who never knew you will inherit it. Sell it. Spend it. Forget you. In three generations, no one will remember Varon."

The merchant's jaw tightened almost imperceptibly.

"But this seed," Cassian pressed, "this connects. Plant it, and forty years from now, someone will harvest it. Save a seed. Plant it again. And again. And somewhere, generations from now, someone will say: 'This came from Varon's garden. He gave it life.' That's worth more than gold."

Silence.

Varon stared at him for a long moment. Then, slowly, he reached for the envelope.

His hands were shaking.

He opened it carefully, tipping the single seed into his palm. It was small, dark, unremarkable. But as he looked at it, Cassian saw the merchant's eyes redden.

"Your father," Varon said, his voice rough, "tried to give me one of these. Years ago. When he needed money for one of his fool expeditions. He offered me seeds instead of coin." He laughed, a harsh sound. "I mocked him. Called him mad. Told him seeds were worthless to a man of business."

Varon closed his fist around the seed. "I was wrong."

Cassian's throat tightened. This was the first time anyone had spoken well of his father. The first time someone had suggested Rowan understood something profound.

"He saw what I couldn't," Varon continued. "Or wouldn't. That some things matter more than their price." He looked up at Cassian, and his expression was raw. "I've spent seventy-three years winning every negotiation. Every trade. I always get the better end of the deal. And I'm going to die alone in a house full of expensive things that mean nothing to anyone."

He set the seed down gently on the counter, then turned and retrieved a wooden case from the shelf behind him. Inside was a surveying compass—brass and glass, precision-made, worth every bit of forty royals.

"I accept the trade," Varon said quietly.

As the compass and the seed changed hands, Cassian felt something shift in the air. The shimmer around both objects pulsed, equalized, and settled. Not in price—they would never be equal in price. But in *meaning*, in *value*, they balanced perfectly.

It had worked.

Cassian had read the fragments correctly. Interpreted the abstract impressions. Made the connection.

This wasn't just the medallion. This was his ability to translate the coin's cryptic language into truth.

A rush of accomplishment flooded through him. He'd done it.

Varon carefully placed the seed in a small wooden box, handling it like precious glass. For a long moment, he just stared at it. Then he looked up at Cassian, and his eyes were wet.

"I'm seventy-three years old," he said quietly. "When I was your age, I had a woman who wanted to marry me. Meredith. Merchant's daughter from Corwell. She wanted children. A home. Said she could see us growing old together." He paused. "I told her I needed to build my fortune first. Make my name. That we'd marry once I'd established myself."

His jaw tightened. "Five years, I said. Just five years. She waited. Then ten years. She waited. Then fifteen. And then one day I came back from a trade journey to find she'd married someone else. A baker. A man with nothing but flour on his hands and love in his heart." 

Varon's thumb traced the edge of the wooden box. "She died twenty years ago. Six children. Fourteen grandchildren. A life that *mattered*. And I... I have a warehouse of expensive things and an empty house."

He looked directly at Cassian. "Your father came to me thirty years ago. Before you were born. He was already chasing his myths and legends, already spending money he didn't have. He needed funding for some expedition. I refused, naturally. But before he left, he tried to give me a seed like this. Said: 'Varon, you're building an empire of things that will turn to dust. Plant this instead. Grow something that outlives you.'"

Varon's voice cracked. "I laughed at him. Told him he was mad. That seeds were worthless to a man of business." He shook his head. "He was trying to save me from becoming this. And I was too blind to see it."

Cassian felt his throat tighten. This wasn't just about a trade. This was about his father seeing something true, something profound, and being mocked for it. How many others had Rowan tried to help? How many had called him mad?

"He understood something I didn't," Varon continued. "That there are things worth more than profit. Worth more than winning. I've spent fifty years getting the better end of every deal, and I have nothing to show for it but regret." He looked at the seed again. "Maybe it's too late for me. Maybe I've already traded away everything that mattered. But at least... at least I can plant this. Let something grow that outlasts my mistakes."

"It's not too late," Cassian said, surprised by the conviction in his own voice.

Varon smiled sadly. "You're young. You still believe in redemption." He closed the box gently. "Come back in spring. I'll show you where I plant it. And maybe... maybe you can tell me more about your father. I think I owe him the courtesy of remembering him properly."

Cassian nodded, not trusting himself to speak.

As he left Varon's shop, the weight of the compass in his hands felt different. Not just a tool, but proof that his father had been right about something fundamental. That value existed beyond price. That some trades mattered more than others.

And that maybe, just maybe, Cassian could learn to see what his father had seen.

---

Over the next several days, Cassian experimented cautiously.

He didn't announce his ability. Didn't advertise. He simply... watched. Observed. Tested quietly.

In the marketplace, he would stand at the edges and study the shimmer that danced in front of his eyes. A farmer selling grain to a baker. A woman buying cloth from a weaver. He focused on his sixth sense, trying to understand what each person truly valued in the exchange.

Sometimes it was simple: gold for goods.

But other times, things went layers deeper. A mother buying bread valued relief from her children's hunger. In his mind's eye, Cassian saw an image of small hands reaching out, small mouths opening, and being filled. A man buying wine wanted to forget everything—and Cassian visualized this through impressions of shadows closing in, symbolizing the drowning of memories.

The medallion brought it all to the surface.

Cassian tried small interventions. Private ones.

The baker's assistant had lingered near the shop for days, clearly wanting to speak to his employer, but hesitating. Cassian watched, reading the impressions: duty versus fear, obligation versus need. The assistant wanted time away—family emergency, perhaps? But feared asking.

Cassian approached the baker privately. "Your assistant needs three days leave. His mother is sick in the next town."

The baker frowned. "He didn't tell me."

"He's afraid to ask. But I can manage your accounts for three days. No charge. Call it... an investment in community relations."

The baker agreed. The assistant left, grateful but confused. "How did you know?" he'd asked.

Cassian had no good answer.

He tried again with the cooper, old Breven. The man's accounts were in shambles—not through incompetence, but through stress. Cassian saw the impressions: weights pressing down, sleepless nights, a secret gnawing at his chest. After careful observation, he realized: Breven had overcharged the temple for repairs months ago. The error haunted him.

Cassian arranged a quiet meeting. "The temple's books show a discrepancy in your favor. I can help you return the excess and frame it as a voluntary correction. The priest values honesty. He'll respect the gesture."

Breven stared. "How did you..."

"I notice patterns," Cassian said simply.

The correction was made. Breven's relief was palpable. But the look he gave Cassian afterward wasn't just gratitude—it was wariness. *How much does this man see?*

Each small success taught Cassian something. The medallion showed truth, but interpreting it was an art. Sometimes the impressions were clear: flowing sand for time, interlocking hands for trust. Other times they were maddeningly abstract: spiraling circles, distant echoes, colors he couldn't name.

He was learning. But slowly. Carefully.

And he was beginning to understand something unsettling: he could see what people valued, what they feared, what they wanted. He could see the machinery of human desire laid bare.

It was intoxicating. And isolating.

---

Five days after the trade with Varon, the baker's wife brought Cassian fresh bread.

He was in the counting house, working on the quarterly tax report, when she knocked. "Master Cassian? I wanted to thank you for helping my son. He made it to his mother's bedside before... well. He was able to say goodbye."

She set the bread on his desk—a small loaf, still warm, wrapped in cloth.

Cassian looked at it, and immediately the medallion's sense activated. The shimmer appeared: warmth, gratitude, open hands. Abstract impressions of giving freely, expecting nothing.

But his mind immediately began analyzing. *Why would she give this? What does she want? Is this creating an obligation? Will she expect favors for her family now? Is this a down payment on future requests?*

He focused harder on the impressions. Warm light. Flowing water. Open hands.

*But that's too simple. There's always more beneath the surface. Everyone wants something, even if they don't know it yet. Maybe she's establishing a relationship for future needs. Maybe her son will need something else later. Maybe she's paying forward in case her family faces problems.*

"Master Cassian?" She was watching him with a concerned expression. "Is the bread not acceptable?"

"What do you want for it?" Cassian asked.

She blinked. "Want?"

"In exchange. What's the expectation here?"

"I... it's a gift. A thank you. You helped my son be with his mother before she passed. I wanted to show gratitude."

Cassian frowned, consulting the impressions again. They still showed simple generosity. But that couldn't be all of it. Nothing was ever that straightforward.

"Are you certain there's no obligation being created?" he pressed. "Because if there are terms, it's better to establish them clearly now."

The baker's wife's expression shifted—something closing off behind her eyes. "I see. Forgive me, Master Cassian. I didn't mean to impose." She reached for the bread.

"No, you can leave it," Cassian said. "I just want to understand the transaction."

"It's not a transaction." Her voice had gone cold. "It was meant to be kindness. But I see you don't... Good day, sir."

She left quickly.

Cassian sat alone, staring at the bread. He checked the impressions one more time: warmth, gratitude, open hands. Simple. Genuine.

So why had she left upset?

He didn't understand. The impressions had been clear. She'd offered freely. So why had his clarification offended her?

*Maybe she didn't realize she was creating an obligation,* he reasoned. *Maybe she didn't understand the implications of the gift. I was just being thorough.*

He wrapped the bread and set it aside. There was work to do.

But the interaction nagged at him for the rest of the day.

---

That night, as Cassian stepped outside the counting house and began to lock up, a cloaked figure stepped out of the shadows.

He was still pondering his interaction with the baker's wife, trying to understand where he'd gone wrong. The figure stood ten feet away, hood pulled low.

"You're going to get yourself killed."

Cassian's hand went to his pocket, where the medallion rested. "Who are you?"

"Someone who's watched others like you make the same mistakes." The voice was male, rough with age. "You're not as subtle as you think."

"I don't know what you mean."

"Yes, you do." The figure's posture was relaxed but alert. "You inherited something. You're learning to use it. And you're leaving traces."

Cassian's pulse quickened. How did he know? He tried to read the hooded figure with his sixth sense.

Impressions came immediately: a light illuminating the darkness. Nothing more.

"What do you want from me?" Cassian asked, probing deeper.

"Just delivering a warning" said the figure. Then he turned to leave.

"Wait—" Cassian started forward. "At least tell me who to watch for. If you're trying to manipulate my behavior, give me something actionable."

The figure stopped but didn't turn back. "You want something tangible? Fine. Stay out of the capital. Don't show your gift to anyone you don't absolutely trust. And if someone offers you a trade that seems too good to be true, it is." A pause. "That's all I came to say."

They walked away into the darkness, leaving Cassian standing alone in the empty street.

He watched the shadows where they'd disappeared, mind churning. That last part had been practical. Actionable. *Stay out of the capital.* That suggested someone powerful there was looking for people like him. *Don't show your gift.* Obvious enough, but the emphasis implied the danger was more immediate than he'd realized.

---

Over the following week, Cassian threw himself into his studies.

He documented everything in a leather-bound journal he'd purchased specifically for this purpose. Every impression, every correlation, every pattern he observed. The medallion showed him raw data—abstract imagery, emotional resonances—and his mind worked to translate it into systematic understanding.

Time appeared as flowing sand or lengthening shadows. Trust as interlocking hands or foundations of stone. Grief as empty vessels, hope as rising light, pain as broken glass. Each emotion, each value, had its own symbolic language that he was learning to read.

He filled page after page with observations and theories. The more he documented, the more patterns emerged. He wasn't just learning individual trades anymore. He was beginning to see the entire invisible economy that governed human interaction. Every relationship was a ledger of debts and credits. Every emotion had a value that could be quantified, transferred, traded.

It was elegant. Beautiful. Consuming.

---

Ten days after his trade with Varon, Cassian was working late in the counting house when he noticed something odd.

He'd been reviewing the marketplace dispute records—minor conflicts between merchants that the magistrate's office typically arbitrated. Most were simple: disagreements over prices, accusations of short-weighting, arguments about stall positions.

But as he read through them, patterns emerged.

The baker's wife had fallen ill two years ago. The records showed she'd consulted a traveling healer who'd taken payment in the form of "future consideration"—terms left deliberately vague.

Old Breven's financial troubles had started after he'd accepted a generous loan from a well-dressed stranger who'd asked for no collateral, no interest, just "a small favor when the time comes."

The cooper's apprentice had left town abruptly, and his father had mentioned the boy had met someone who "offered him opportunities beyond his station."

Small threads. Disconnected events.

But Cassian's new awareness saw something others had missed: a pattern of asymmetric exchanges. Trades that looked generous on the surface but created undefined future obligations. Value given freely in the present, with costs deferred to an uncertain later.

It reminded him of something. Something he couldn't quite place.

These weren't random acts of charity. These were calculated investments. Someone was making trades with the townsfolk, and the terms were deliberately obscure.

But who? And why?

Cassian made notes in the margin of the dispute records. He'd look into it further when time permitted. For now, it was just a curiosity. A pattern that might mean something or might mean nothing.

He returned to his work, unaware that he'd just glimpsed the edge of something far larger and far more dangerous than he could imagine.

Outside, the autumn wind picked up, scattering leaves across the market square. In the shadows between buildings, a cloaked figure watched the counting house window for a moment longer, then turned and disappeared into the night.

The warning had been given. Whether the boy would heed it or not remained to be seen.

But the Hollow was coming. 

And time was running out.
